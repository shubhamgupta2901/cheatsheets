 ### Why Background Processing

* Every Android app has a main thread (also called UI Thread) which is in charge of handling UI, if there is too much work happening on this thread, the app appears to hang or slow down, leading to an undesirable user experience. This leads to **Application Not Responding** Error(ANR).

* Any long-running operations such as decoding a bitmap, accessing the disk, or performing network requests should be done on a separate background thread. In general, anything that takes more than a few milliseconds should be delegated to a background thread.

* This will improve the app performance by providing better user experience and save us from ANR. Also there are some operations like HTTP calls which are not allowed to be performed in the main thread.

### Threads And Runnables

* Android supports the usage of the ```Thread``` class to perform asynchronous processing. Android also supplies the ```java.util.concurrent``` package to perform something in the background. 

* This issue can be solved using **Handlers**. A ```Handler``` object registers itself with the thread in which it is created. It provides a channel to send data to this thread, for example the main thread. 

* The data which can be posted via the ```Handler``` class can be an instance of the ```Message``` or the ```Runnable``` class. A ```Handler``` is particularly useful if you have to post data multiple times to the main thread.

 ### Problems with Threads in Android
 
 * Android is a single threaded UI framework. There is one UI thread responsible for drawing on the canvas. **If we touch UI in any other thread, we will meet ```CalledFromWrongThreadException```**. So no other thread can directly handle UI. Therefore some mechanism is needed to perform UI work in UI thread. 
 
 * **If we need to update the UI from another UI Thread, we need to synchronize with the UI thread**. We will need to joing the thread to UI Thread using ```Thread.join()``` to know that the task assigned was completed or not. It gets even tricikier if we want to do some work in background thread partially, and update the results in the UI Thread. Because of these restrictions and complexity we need additional constructed classes in Android to handle concurrency in comparison with standard Java.
 
 * In addition, Java threads are one-time use only and die after executing its run method.

 ### Communicate with the UI thread
 
 * **Handler** is part of Android's framework which can be used to manage threads. **Handlers allow communicating back with UI thread from another background thread**.
 
 * Basically, Hanlders along with Loopers implement a common concurrency pattern known as **Pipeline Thread Pattern**. Here's how it works:
  1. The Pipeline Thread holds a queue of tasks which are just some units of work that can be executed or processed.
  2. Other threads can safely push new tasks into the Pipeline Threadâ€™s queue at any time.
  3. The Pipeline Thread processes the queued tasks one after another. If there are no tasks queued, it blocks until a task appears in the queue.
  
 ** **Looper turns our UI thread into a Pipeline Thread and Handler gives us a mechanism to push tasks into the UI thread from any other threads.**
 
 * Here is how Android implements the Pipeline Thread Pattern to solve the communication issue between threads:
  1. The UI Thread maintains a MessageQueue which contains a list of tasks(```Messages``` and ```Runnables``` : they are set of executable code) to be performed on this thread.
  2. The UI Thread also has a Handler. Any thread which has a reference of this handler can use it to add tasks to the MessageQueue of UI Thread (This can be done from any thread, but they need to be part of same process).
  3. The Looper in UI Thread polls the MessageQueue to look for the next task in the queue. As soon as a message is encountered, it is forwarded to its respective handler to execute it in the UI Thread. 
 
* EXAMPLE: Consider a situation where a background thread is performing a time consuming operation. Everytime some part of the operation is completed it has to update the UI Thread about the progress of task. UI Thread has a progress bar which it would like to update so that the user using the application is aware about the progress of background task.

* We can use Handler to facilitate the communication between UI Thread and the Background Thread.

```java
public class DemoActivity extends AppCompatActivity {

    private ProgressBar progressBar;
    private Button button;
    private Handler handler;

    @Override
    protected void onCreate(@Nullable Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_demo);
        bindViews();
        initializeHandler();
        setOnClickListeners();
    }

    private void bindViews() {
        progressBar = findViewById(R.id.progressBar1);
        progressBar.setMax(10);
        button = findViewById(R.id.button1);
    }

    private void initializeHandler() {
        /**Initialized in the main thread, the handler belongs to this thread.
         Any thread that has reference of this handler can use it to call sendMessage with a message,
         That message will be enqueued in the MessageQueue of this thread. And once the turns comes for this
         method, it will be executed by the handler in this thread by calling handle Message.**/
        handler = new Handler() {
            @Override
            public void handleMessage(Message msg) {
                progressBar.setProgress(msg.arg1);
            }
        };

    }

    private void setOnClickListeners() {
        button.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() {
            @Override
            public void onClick(View v) {
                new BackgroundThread(handler).start();
            }
        });
    }

}
```

```java
public class BackgroundThread extends Thread {
    private  Handler handler;

    BackgroundThread(Handler handler){
        //receives the reference of handler from the main thread.
        this.handler = handler;
    }
    @Override
    public void run() {
        super.run();
        for (int i = 0; i<10; i++){

            SystemClock.sleep(500);
            /**Creates a new message every time and sends it to the UI Thread. It will be executed in
            the UI thread, when it will be dequeued from the Message Queue from the Looper.
            Note a new message instance is created every time, and not reused to avoid runtime error.**/
            Message message = Message.obtain();
            message.arg1 = i+1;
            handler.sendMessage(message);
        }
    }
}
```

* This is how we communicate with UI Thread:
 1. UI Thread starts a background thread to perform a background operation.
 2. Background Thread starts the background operation, it wants to update the UI Thread regarding the progress of the task.
 3. It gets the UI Thread's Handler reference and sends messages periodically using ```sendMessage()```.This message will go inside the MessageQueue of the main thread.
 4. Looper in the main thread keeps polling the message queue to find if theres a task to be performed. 
 5. When this task added by background thread is dequeued, the Looper will open the message and forward this message to its handler.
 6. Handler object has method handleMessage() in which whatever code we have written will be executed in the UI Thread.
 7. So a handler will take a message from another thread, enqueue it in the main thread's Message Queue, and when time comes, Looper will dispatch this task to handler asking it to execute it in the main thread.
 
 MODIFICATION IN ABOVE CODE:
 
 * In above code the handler is not created as a static class, If it is not static, it will have a reference to our Activity object. Handler objects for the same thread all share a common Looper object, which they post messages to and read from. As messages contain target Handler, as long as there are messages with target handler in the message queue, the handler cannot be garbage collected. If handler is not static, our Activity cannot be garbage collected, even after being destroyed.This may lead to memory leaks, for some time at least - as long as the messages stay in the queue. 
 
 ```java
 public class DemoActivity extends AppCompatActivity {

    private ProgressBar progressBar;
    private Button button;
    private ProgressHandler handler;

    @Override
    protected void onCreate(@Nullable Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_demo);
        bindViews();
        handler = new ProgressHandler(progressBar);
        setOnClickListeners();
    }

    private void bindViews() {
        progressBar = findViewById(R.id.progressBar1);
        progressBar.setMax(10);
        button = findViewById(R.id.button1);
    }

    private void setOnClickListeners() {
        button.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() {
            @Override
            public void onClick(View v) {
                new BackgroundThread(handler).start();
            }
        });
    }

    static class ProgressHandler extends Handler{
        ProgressBar progressBar;
        public ProgressHandler(ProgressBar progressBar) {
            this.progressBar = progressBar;
        }

        @Override
        public void handleMessage(Message msg) {
            super.handleMessage(msg);
            progressBar.setProgress(msg.arg1);
        }
    }
    
}
 ```

 ### Loopers
 
  *  **Looper** is a class that keeps a thread alive, loops through the **MessageQueue** of its thread, and sends messages to the corresponding handler to process.
  
  * The Looper is named so because it implements the loop â€“ takes a task from the queue, executes it (or delegates it to someone to execute it), and then take next task and so on. ```Looper.loop()``` has an infinite for loop being run checking for the next message. **It is a blocking method ensuring that the ```run()``` method blocks and is not finished***.So basically a Looper uses a synchronized MessageQueue thatâ€™s used to process Messages placed on the queue. It implements a Thread-specific event loop that waits for and dispatches Messages to handlers. 
  
* By default, a thread does not have a message loop associated with it, hence doesnâ€™t have a Looper either. To create a Looper for a thread and dedicate that thread to process messages serially from a message loop, you can use the Looper class.

```java
class LooperThread extends Thread {
    public Handler mHandler;
 
    @Override
    public void run() {
        // Initialize the current thread as a Looper
        // (this thread can have a MessageQueue now)
        Looper.prepare();
 
        mHandler = new Handler() {
            @Override
            public void handleMessage(Message msg) {
                // process incoming messages here
            }
        };
 
        // Run the message queue in this thread
        Looper.loop();
    }
}
```
* **A thread can have only one associated Looper and hence a single message queue.** So if multiple threads tries to send messages to a particular Looper thread then all of them will be processed sequentially. Trying to setting up another Looper will throw a runtime error with a message like this java.lang.RuntimeException: Only one Looper may be created per thread.

* There are 2 methods to terminate a Looper:
 1. ```Looper.quit()``` â€“ Terminates the Looper without processing any more messages in the MessageQueue. Any attempt to post messages to the queue will fail once the Looper is asked to quit. For example, the ```Handler.sendMessage()``` or ```Handler.post()``` dispatching methods will return false.
 2. ```Looper.quitSafely()``` â€“ Similar to the previous version but makes sure that the pending messages that are due to be delivered are handled. Messages with due times in the future wonâ€™t be delivered before the Looper quits though.
 
 * Terminating the Looper lets the thread resume running the method which had invoked the call to ```Looper.loop()```. The old Looper or even a new Looper cannot be started anymore. So the thread can no longer enqueue and handle messages. ```Looper.prepare()``` called again should throw a ```RuntimeException``` whereas ```Looper.loop()``` called again will block but no messages will be dispatched from the queue.
 
 * **The UI thread is the only thread that is associated with a Looper by default before the application components are initialized**. There are a few differences (or maybe specialities that it has) between it and other application thread Loopers: 
   * It cannot be terminated with ```Looper.quit()```. A ```RuntimeException``` is thrown if that is tried.
   * It is accessible from everywhere through the ```Looper.getMainLooper()``` method.
   * It is associated with the UI thread via ```Looper.prepareMainLooper()``` and can be done only once per application. Trying to call this in some other Thread to attach the main looper will throw an exception.
