  * Inheritance
  

* Inheritance is one of the important concepts in OOPS. It is a mechanism which allows one class to inherit the features of another class.

* Inheritance supports the concept of **reusability**, i.e. when we want to create a new class and there is already a class that includes some of the code that we want, we can derive our new class from the existing class. By doing this, we are reusing the fields and methods of the existing class.

* **Super Class**: The class whose features are inherited is known as super class(or a base class or a parent class).

* **Sub Class**: The class that inherits the other class is known as sub class(or a derived class, extended class, or child class). The subclass can add its own fields and methods in addition to the superclass fields and methods.

* The keyword used for inheritance is **```extends```**.
