## Singleton classes in JAVA
* In a object oriented environment, a singleton class is a class that can have only one object (an instance of the class) at a time.
*  After first time, we simply can not create the instance of a singleton class. We achieve this by making the constructors of the class private. 
* To design a singleton class:
  1.  Make constructor as private.
  2.  Write a static method that has return type object of this singleton class. Use it as an entry point for other classes to get access to its instance.
  
### Implementing Singleton Class
```java
   // Java program implementing Singleton class with getInstance() method
class Singleton
{
    // static variable singleInstance of type Singleton
    private static Singleton singleInstance = null;
 
    // variable of type String
    public String s;
 
    // private constructor restricted to this class itself
    private Singleton()
    {
        s = "Hello I am a string part of Singleton class";
    }
 
    // static method to create instance of Singleton class
    public static Singleton getInstance()
    {
        if (singleInstance == null)
            singleInstance = new Singleton();
 
        return singleInstance;
    }
}
 
// Driver Class
class Main
{
    public static void main(String args[])
    {
        // instantiating Singleton class with variable x
        Singleton x = Singleton.getInstance();
 
        // instantiating Singleton class with variable y
        Singleton y = Singleton.getInstance();
 
        // instantiating Singleton class with variable z
        Singleton z = Singleton.getInstance();
 
        // changing variable of instance x
        x.s = (x.s).toUpperCase();
 
        System.out.println("String from x is " + x.s);
        System.out.println("String from y is " + y.s);
        System.out.println("String from z is " + z.s);
        System.out.println("\n");
 
        // changing variable of instance z
        z.s = (z.s).toLowerCase();
 
        System.out.println("String from x is " + x.s);
        System.out.println("String from y is " + y.s);
        System.out.println("String from z is " + z.s);
    }
}
  ```
*  Output
 ```
String from x is HELLO I AM A STRING PART OF SINGLETON CLASS
String from y is HELLO I AM A STRING PART OF SINGLETON CLASS
String from z is HELLO I AM A STRING PART OF SINGLETON CLASS


String from x is hello i am a string part of singleton class
String from y is hello i am a string part of singleton class
String from z is hello i am a string part of singleton class
 ```
 *  Explanation: In the Singleton class, when we first time call ```getInstance()``` method, it creates an object of the class with name singleInstance and return it to the variable. Since singleInstance is static, it is changed from null to some object. Next time, if we try to call getInstance() method, since singleInstance is not null, it is returned to the variable, instead of instantiating the Singleton class again. This part is done by if condition.
