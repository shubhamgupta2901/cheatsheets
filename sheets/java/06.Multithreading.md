* **Multitasking** :In old days, computer only had one CPU, and was only capable of executing a single program at a time. Later came multitasking which meant that computers could execute multiple programs (AKA tasks or processes) at the same time. It wasn't really "at the same time" though. The single CPU was shared between the programs. The operating system would switch between the programs running, executing each of them for a little while before switching.( Modern computers, though, come with multi core CPUs).

* **Multithreading**: Then came multithreading which means that you could have multiple threads of execution inside the same program. Multithreaded programs are able to simultaneously execute multiple sequences of instructions. Each instruction sequence has its own unique flow of control that is independent of all others. These independently executed instruction sequences are known as **threads**.Mutliple threads in a program are reading and writing the same memory simultaneously.
Threads are not complete processes in and of themselves. They are a separate flow of control that occurs within a process.

* **Physical vs Logical Concurrency**: In single CPU systems, only a single thread of execution occurs at a given instant. The CPU quickly switches back and forth between several threads to create the illusion that the threads are executing at the same time. This is **logical concurrency**.Single-processor systems support **logical concurrency**, not physical concurrency.

* On multiprocessor systems, several threads execute at the same time, and **physical concurrency** is achieved.

* **Thread**:  A thread is an independent path of execution within a program. Many threads can run concurrently within a program. Every thread in Java is created and controlled by the ```java.lang.Thread class```. A Java program can have many threads, and these threads can run concurrently, either asynchronously or synchronously. 

* All Java programs have at least one thread, known as the **main thread**, which is created by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) at the programâ€™s start, when the ```main()``` method is invoked with the main thread.


### Ways to create Threads in JAVA
There are two ways to start a thread in JAVA: 
  1. One is extend ```Thread``` class and override the implmentation of ```run()```.
  
  ```java
  
  class Runner extends Thread {

    String threadNumber;

    public Runner(String threadNumber) {
        this.threadNumber = threadNumber;
        System.out.println("Thread " + threadNumber + " initialized.");
    }


    public void run() {

        for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
            System.out.println("Thread " + threadNumber + ": " + i+" | ");
            try {
                Thread.sleep(1000);
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
        }
    }
}

public class Demo1 {

    /**
     * When we run main(), we can see that the two threads are running concurrently.
     * Notice we have called {@link Thread#start()} and not {@link Thread#run()}
     * This is because calling run() will run the code in the main thread of the application. So when {@link Thread#sleep(long)} method is called
     * it causes the currently executing thread to sleep (temporarily cease  execution), which is the main thread() and the code is run in sequential manner.
     * <p>
     * Calling start() will start a new thread, which will call run() in that thread, and interleaved output can be observed. Which means both the threads
     * are running concurrently.
     *
     * @param args
     */
    public static void main(String[] args) {

       
        System.out.println("Main thread enter ");

        Runner runner1 = new Runner(String.valueOf(1));
        runner1.start();

        Runner runner2 = new Runner(String.valueOf(2));
        runner2.start();

        System.out.println("Main thread exit ");  


    }

}

```

OUTPUT: 
```java
Main thread enter 
Thread 1 initialized.
Thread 2 initialized.
Main thread exit 
Thread 2: 0 | Thread 1: 0 | Thread 2: 1 | Thread 1: 1 | Thread 2: 2 | Thread 1: 2 | Thread 2: 3 | Thread 1: 3 | Thread 2: 4 | Thread 1: 4 | 


OR 

Main thread enter 
Thread 1 initialized.
Thread 2 initialized.
Main thread exit 
Thread 1: 0 | Thread 2: 0 | Thread 1: 1 | Thread 2: 1 | Thread 1: 2 | Thread 2: 2 | Thread 1: 3 | Thread 2: 3 | Thread 1: 4 | Thread 2: 4 | 

```

* Once the thread is initialized, we can call ```start()``` to start the execution of code written inside ```run()```. NOtice we have called ```start()``` and not ```run()```. This is because calling ```run()``` will run the code in the currently executing thread which wants to start this thread,in this case the main thread of application, and the code is run is sequential manner.

In that case the output would look something like this:

OUTPUT:
```java
Main thread enter 
Thread 1 initialized.
Thread 1: 0 | Thread 1: 1 | Thread 1: 2 | Thread 1: 3 | Thread 1: 4 | Thread 2 initialized.
Thread 2: 0 | Thread 2: 1 | Thread 2: 2 | Thread 2: 3 | Thread 2: 4 | Main thread exit 

```

ii.Second way is to start a thread in JAVA is to make your class implement ```Runnable``` and override ```run()```.Then we can pass this as a parameter to constructor of Thread class.
    
```java
    class Runner2 implements  Runnable{


    String threadNumber;

    public Runner2(String threadNumber) {
        this.threadNumber = threadNumber;
        System.out.println("Thread "+ threadNumber+" initialized.");
    }


    @Override
    public void run() {

        for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
            System.out.print("Thread "+ threadNumber+": " + i+" | ");
            try {
                Thread.sleep(1000);
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
        }

    }
 }
public class Demo2 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Thread thread  = new Thread(new Runner2("1"));
        thread.start();

        Thread thread2  = new Thread(new Runner2("2"));
        thread2.start();
    }
}
```

OUTPUT: 
```java
Thread 1 initialized.
Thread 2 initialized.
Thread 2: 0 | Thread 1: 0 | Thread 2: 1 | Thread 1: 1 | Thread 2: 2 | Thread 1: 2 | Thread 2: 3 | Thread 1: 3 | Thread 2: 4 | Thread 1: 4 | 


OR 

Thread 1 initialized.
Thread 2 initialized.
Thread 1: 0 | Thread 2: 0 | Thread 1: 1 | Thread 2: 1 | Thread 1: 2 | Thread 2: 2 | Thread 1: 3 | Thread 2: 3 | Thread 1: 4 | Thread 2: 4 | 

```
NOTE: If we call the ```run()``` instead of ```start()``` while creating the thread, the code inside ```run()``` will be executed but in the thread of calling method. In the above example it will run of main thread.

## Volatile keyword

Consider the following example: 

```java
class Runner3 implements  Runnable{
    boolean running  = true;run

    @Override
    public void run() {
        //Background thread
        while(running){
            System.out.println("Hello");
            try {
                Thread.sleep(300);
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
        }

    }

    public void stopRunning(){
        this.running = false;
    }
}
public class Demo3 {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Runner3 runner = new Runner3();
        Thread thread = new Thread(runner);
        thread.start();

        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        sc.nextLine();

        runner.stopRunning();

    }
}
```

As you can see, the value of running is never changed from the background thread. It is changed by a method that is called in the main thread of application. Which means the variable running is used by two threads.The expected behaviour of the above block of code is, Hello will keep printing, till somebody presses the Enter key.  And mostly the above code works fine.
In certain machines, or implementation of language, the value of running may be cached by the background thread.It might think that the value of ```running``` is never modified by me, so it can cache the value of ```running```. And everytime the while loop checks the value of ```running```, it is accessed from the cache and the value is always true. Which means when you press enter the while loop does not stop running.

### synchronized keyword

Consider the following example: 

```java
public class Demo4 {

    private int count = 0;

    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        Demo4 demo = new Demo4();
        demo.doWork();
    }

    public void doWork() throws InterruptedException {

        Thread thread1 = new Thread(() -> {
            for (int i = 0; i < 10000; i++)
                count++;
        });

        Thread thread2 = new Thread(() -> {
            for (int i = 0; i < 10000; i++)
                count++;
        });

        thread1.start();
        thread2.start();

        /**
         * {@link Thread} class provides the join() method which allows one thread to wait until another thread completes its execution.
         * If t is a Thread object whose thread is currently executing, then t.join(); it causes the current thread to pause its execution
         * until thread of t completes its execution.
         */

        thread1.join();
        thread2.join();
        System.out.println(count);
    }
}
```
The expected answer here is 20000.Because both the threads are incrementing the value of count 10000 times each.
However if I run the code, it can be seen that the value of count is not always 20000(It is less than 20000).
The reason for this is ```count++ or count = count+1``` is actually a three step instruction to computer.
1)FETCH the value of count.
2)INCREMENT the value of count.
3)UPDATE the incremented value to count.

Since both the threads are concurrently using the count variable,there is a possibility that the value of count is INCREMENTED by thread1 but before UPDATING,the value of count is FETCHED by thread2.Suppose the value of count is 100, thread1 INCREMENTS the value, but before UPDATING the value, thread2 FETCHES the value of count which is still 100 so thread2 increments 100 to 101 but actually count should have been incremented from 101 to 102.
         
It can ofcourse be lot worse than that , like while thread2 is reading the value of count, count has already incremented it twice but before thread1's UPDATE, thread2's FETCH occurs.

 **Solution:**  Above, it can be seen that some of the increments of count has been skipped, because both the threads read the value concurrently and before the increment operation was completed and value was updated, the other thread would fetch the unupdated value and increment it.What we really need to do is, we need to find some way of making sure that in that time when a thread reads the value of count,incrments and stores it back to count, no other thread should access it and changed it. 
 
 **synchronized keyword**: Every object in JAVA has an intrinsic lock (monitor lock or mutex).When we use synchronized keyword while defining the method,  you have to acquire this intrinsic lock before you can call the method.Only one thread can acquire a thread at a time. So when one thread acquires this lock and runs {@link #increment()} and if another thread tries to call the method,then the second thread will have to wait until the first thread releases the intrinsic lock which happens when the method finshes execution.


``` java 
public class Demo5 {


    int count = 0;

    private synchronized  void increment(){
        count++;
    }

    private void doWork() throws InterruptedException {
        Thread thread1 = new Thread(() -> {
            for(int i = 0; i<100000; i++)
               increment();
        });
        Thread thread2 = new Thread(()->{
            for(int i = 0; i<100000; i++)
                increment();
        });

        thread1.start();
        thread2.start();

        thread1.join();
        thread2.join();

        System.out.println(count);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        Demo5 demo = new Demo5();
        demo.doWork();
    }
}
```
