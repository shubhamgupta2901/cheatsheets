 ## Compilation and Execution of Java Program
 
 #### Compilers
* A program is written in a high level language which the machine does not understand. For the source code to be understood by the processor, it needs to be in a machine-level language, which could be understood by processors. Here comes the role of a compiler. The compiler converts the high-level language  into a format understood by the machines. Therefore, a compiler is a program that translates the source code for another program from a high level programming language into a sequence of machine instructions that can be executed by the CPU.

#### Bytecode and JVM
* However in case of JAVA it is different. The JAVA compiler (javac compiler) does not generate machine level instructions that can be understood by machines directly. It generates an intermediate bytecode. A Java runtime system called JVM (Java Virtual Machine) is required to interpret the bytecode and generate machine code which is understood by machines.

* So, in Java , all source code is first written in plain text files ending with the ```.java``` extension. Those source files are then compiled into ```.class``` files by the javac compiler. A ```.class``` file does not contain code that is native to your processor; it instead contains bytecode—the language of the JVM.

* A JVM depends of the operating system(platform dependent). So Mac OS X will have a different JVM and Windows will have a different JVM. 

* JVM is responsible for interpreting the bytecode and converting it into the machine code. A Windows JVM converts it to machine code that can be understood by Windows and a Mac OS JVM will convert the bytecode to a language understood by Mac OS.

#### Platform Independence

* A Platform= Hardware+Operating System. Anything which is platform indpendent can be run in any computer hardware and operating system. Java is platform indepedent so java program can be written in any platform and still run on any other 
operating system and hardware.

* This is because of the bytecode which is platform indepedent. When java compiler compiles any code then it generates the byte code not the machine native code(unlike C compiler). Now this byte code needs an interpreter to execute on a machine. This interpreter is JVM. So JVM reads that byte code(that is machine indepedent) amd execute it. Different JVM is designed for different OS and byte code is able to run on different OS.

#### Step by Step execution of Java program
 1. Whenever, a program is written in JAVA, the javac compiles it.
 2. The result of the JAVA compiler is the .class file or the bytecode and not the machine native code (unlike C compiler).
 3. The bytecode generated is a non-executable code and needs an interpreter to execute on a machine. This interpreter is the JVM and thus the Bytecode is executed by the JVM.
 4. And finally program runs to give the desired output.
 
 ## Data types in JAVA
 
 There are two types of data types in JAVA: 
  1. Primitive types: int, char, boolean, float etc
  2. Non-primitive(Object type): arrays, interfaces etc
  
  #### Primitive types
  
  | Data Type   | Default value | Size    | Range |
  | ----------- | ------------- |---------|-------|
  |  boolean    |  false        | 1 bit   |false, true |
  |  byte       | 0             | 8 bits  | −128 to 127 |
  |  char       | \u0000 (NULL) | 16 bits | 'u0000' (or 0) to 'uffff' (or 65,535, inclusive)|
  |  short      |  0            | 16 bits |−32768 to 32767 |
  |  int        | 0             |32 bits  | −2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647 |
  |  long       | 0L            | 64 bits | 9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,755,807 |
  |  float      | 0.0           | 64 bits | 3.4e−038 to 3.4e+038 |
  |  double     | 0.0           | 64 bits | 1.7e−308 to 1.7e+038 |

 #### A Closer look at char
 * In JAVA char is defined as 16 bits, (In C it was 8 bits). So the range of values a char can have ranges from Decimal 0 (Hexadecimal 0) to Decimal 65535 (Hexadecimal FFFF).
 
  * This allows JAVA to understand several dozen different character sets for a variety of languages, ranging from ASCII to the Shift Japanese Input System (SJIS) to Unicode. Internally, Java uses the Unicode character set.
 
 * Character set **ASCII** is a 7 bit character set. Thus it defines 2<sup>7</sup> or 128 different characters whose decimal values range from 0 to 127. 
   *  ASCII characters 0-31 and character 127 are nonprinting control characters. 
   * Characters 32-47 are various punctuation and space characters. 
   * Characters 48-57 are the digits 0-9. Characters 58-64 are another group of punctuation characters. 
   * Characters 65-90 are the capital letters A-Z. 
   * Characters 91-96 are a few more punctuation marks. 
   * Characters 97-122 are the lowercase letters a-z. 
   * Finally, characters 123 through 126 are a few remaining punctuation symbols. 
 *  All Java programs can be expressed in pure ASCII. Non-ASCII Unicode characters are encoded as Unicode escapes; that is, written as a backslash ( \), followed by a u, followed by four hexadecimal digits; for example, \u00A9. 
 
 *  **ISO Latin-1** is an 8-bit character set that’s a strict superset of ASCII. It defines 2<sup>8</sup> or 256 different characters whose numeric values range from Decimal 0 to Decimal 255 . The first 128 characters—that is, those numbers with the high-order bit equal to zero—correspond exactly to the ASCII character set. Thus 65 is ASCII A and ISO Latin-1 A; 66 is ASCII B and ISO Latin-1 B; and so on. Where ISO Latin-1 and ASCII diverge is in the characters between 128 and 255 (characters with high bit equal to one). ASCII does not define these characters. ISO Latin-1 uses them for various accented letters like ü needed for non-English languages written in a Roman script, additional punctuation marks and symbols like ©, and additional control characters.
 
 * **Unicode** 
   *  ISO Latin-1 suffices for most Western European languages, but it doesn’t have anywhere near the number of characters required to represent Cyrillic, Greek, Arabic, Hebrew, Persian, or Devanagari, not to mention pictographic languages like Chinese and Japanese. Chinese alone has over 80,000 different characters. 
   *  To handle these scripts and many others, the Unicode character set was invented. Unicode is a 2-byte, (16-bit) character set with 2<sup>16</sup> or 65,536 different possible characters. (Only about 40,000 are used in practice, the rest being reserved for future expansion.) Unicode can handle most of the world’s living languages and a number of dead ones as well.
   *  The first 256 characters of Unicode—that is, the characters whose high-order byte is zero—are identical to the characters of the ISO Latin-1 character set. Thus 65 is ASCII A and Unicode A; 66 is ASCII B and Unicode B and so on.
  * **UTF-8**
    *  Unicode is a relatively inefficient encoding when most of your text consists of ASCII characters. Every character requires the same number of bytes—two—even though some characters are used much more frequently than others. A more efficient encoding would use fewer bits for the more common characters. This is what UTF-8 does.
    *  In UTF-8 the ASCII alphabet is encoded using a single byte, just as in ASCII. The next 1,919 characters are encoded in two bytes. The remaining Unicode characters are encoded in three bytes. However, since these three-byte characters are relatively uncommon,especially in English text, the savings achieved by encoding ASCII in a single byte more than makes up for it.
    
  *  **The char Data Type** 
    *  Character-oriented data in Java is primarily composed of the char primitive data type, char arrays, and Strings, which are stored as arrays of chars internally. 
    *  In Java, a char is a two-byte, unsigned integer, the only unsigned type in Java. Thus, possible char values range from 0 to 2<sup>16</sup>(65,535). Each char represents a particular character in the Unicode character set. chars may be assigned to by using int literals in this range; for example:
    
    ``` char copyright = 169; ```
   chars may also be assigned to by using char literals; that is, the character itself enclosed in single quotes:
    ``` char copyright = '©'; ```
    
   *  With the exception of Unicode itself, most character sets understood by Java do not have equivalents for all the Unicode characters. To encode characters that do not exist in the character set you’re programming with, you can use Unicode escapes. A Unicode escape sequence is an unescaped backslash, followed by any number of u characters, followed by four hexadecimal digits specifying the character to be used. For example:

    ```char copyright = '\u00A9';```
  *  Unicode escapes may be used not just in char literals, but also in strings, identifiers, comments, and even in keywords, separators, operators, and numeric literals. The compiler translates Unicode escapes to actual Unicode characters before it does anything else with a source code file.
    
## Difference between primitive and reference variable

* Variables are declared with a name and a type.
* There are two types of variables in Java, primitive and reference type. All the basic types e.g. ```int, boolean, char, short, float, long and double``` are known as primitive types.
* A primitive variable value is the bits representing the value, A reference variable value is the bits representing a way to get to an object.
* It should be noted here, that **only local primitive variables and reference variables (object references) are stored in stack.** The actual objects are stored in heap.
* Reference variables are references (not exaclty pointers) to the object which is created in **heap memory**.
* With primitive variables, the value of the variable is... the value (5, -26.7, ‘a’). With reference variables (object references), the value of the variable is... bits representing a way to get to a specific object.
* We don't specifically care how any particular JVM implements object references. Sure, they might be a pointer or a pointer to a pointer to the object. All we need to understand is that the value of variable will let us access an object.
* **How big are object reference variables?** We can consider(imagin?)them 64-bit values. **All object references are same size, regardless of size of actual objects to which they refer.** But each JVM might have a different way of representing references, so references on one JVM may be smaller or larger than references on other JVM.
* Another main difference between primitive and reference type is that primitive type always has a value, it can never be ```null``` but reference type can be ```null```, which denotes the absence of value. So if you create a primitive variable of type ```int``` and forget to initialize it then it's value would be ```0```(the default value of integer type in Java) but a reference variable by default has a ```null``` value, which means no reference is assigned to it.
* **Arrays are objects too.** They are always objects whether they're declared to hold primitives or object references.In other words, array objects can have elements which are primitive, but the array itself is always an object.

* It should be noted here that **JAVA is not a pure object oriented language, because it supports primitive data types.** So not everything in JAVA is an object.
* **Why primitive data types?**: For efficiency. Variables of primitive types contain the value directly; variables of non-primitive types are references, referring to an object stored somewhere else in memory.Each time you need to use object of reference type, the JVM needs to lookup the object in memory to get at the value. This isn't needed for primitive types, because the variable contains the value itself, instead of a reference to an object that contains the value.


 ## Is JAVA Pass by value or Pass by reference
 #### Explanation 1
* Everything in Java is pass-by-value. There is no such thing as "pass-by-reference" in Java.It is by design, to keep things simple. 

* Value of primitive variable is bits which represent the value. So when it is passed as a parameter in a method (pass-by-value), a copy of variable is made in memory which contain the same value. These becomes two seperate copies. Any change in one does not modify the other.

* However value reference variable is bits that refer to an object in memory. So when object reference is passed to method parameters,even though it passes the value,their value is actually a reference. So when a copy of that variable is made through pass-by-value,its value also becomes a reference to the same object. **Because two copies of the same reference refer to the same actual object, changes made through one reference variable are visible through the other.**


* Consider the below example:
```java
public static void main(String []args){
  Test test = new Test();
  int a = 10; 
  int b = 20;
  System.out.print(a); // Prints 10
  System.out.print(a); // Prints 20
  badSwap(a,b);
  System.out.print(a); // Prints 10
  System.out.print(a); // Prints 20
}
public static void badSwap(int var1, int var2)
{
  int temp = var1;
  var1 = var2;
  var2 = temp;
}
```
* Here calling ```badSwap()``` does not alter the values of variables.This is because when ```badSwap()``` is called, a copy of variables ```a and b``` is made in memory which contain the values of ```a and b``` and these variables are passed to  ```badSwap()```.

* The above method will also fail if we change the argument type from int to Object, since JAVA passes the object references by value as well.
 
* However consider the following snippet of code: 
 
 ```java
 class Point {
        int x;
        int y;

        Point(int x, int y) {
            this.x = x;
            this.y = y;
        }
 }
 
 public static void main(String [] args){
  Point pnt1 = new Point(0,0);
  Point pnt2 = new Point(0,0);
  
  System.out.println("X: " + pnt1.x + " Y: " +pnt1.y); //X: 0 Y: 0
  System.out.println("X: " + pnt2.x + " Y: " +pnt2.y); //X: 0 Y: 0
 
  tricky(pnt1,pnt2);
 
 System.out.println("X: " + pnt1.x + " Y:" + pnt1.y); //X: 100 Y: 100
  System.out.println("X: " + pnt2.x + " Y: " +pnt2.y); //X: 0 Y: 0
 }
 
 public void tricky(Point arg1, Point arg2)
{
  arg1.x = 100;
  arg1.y = 100;
  Point temp = arg1;
  arg1 = arg2;
  arg2 = temp;
}
 ```
 
* The method successfully alters the value of pnt1, even though it is passed by value; however, a swap of pnt1 and pnt2 fails! 
  This happens because ```pnt1 and pnt2``` are actually references to a memory location where JAVA allocated memory to the object while object creation. So their values are actually reference to a memory location. When we pass ```pnt1 and pnt2``` to ```tricky()```, the call is actually CALL BY VALUE, but since the values of ```pnt1 and pnt2``` are actually references to a memory location, the method arguments too, will get the reference of same memory location. Because JAVA passes the references by value just like any other parameter.This means the references passed to the method are actually copies of the original references.
 Figure 1 below shows two references pointing to the same object after Java passes an object to a method.

 *After method call, the same memory will have two references.*

*  That is why the manipulation of object inside ```tricky()``` is acutally changing the values. However the swap part in ```tricky()``` is simply changing the values of the method arguments, i.e. method arguments will have swapped values, the references they are keeping will be interchanged. This still does not affect the value of original parameters ```pnt1 and pnt2```

![alt text](https://images.techhive.com/images/idge/imported/article/jvw/2000/05/03-qa-0512-pass2b-100158782-orig.gif "")

*Only the method references are swapped, not the original ones.*
 #### Explanation 2
* Java passes the parameters of method by value.The key to understanding this is that something like:

```java 
Dog myDog;
```
is not a Dog; it's actually a pointer to a Dog.

What that means, is when you have
```java
Dog myDog = new Dog("Rover");
foo(myDog);
```
you're essentially passing the address of the created Dog object to the foo method.(I say essentially because Java pointers aren't direct addresses, but it's easiest to think of them that way)
* Suppose the Dog object resides at memory address 42. This means we pass 42 to the method. if the Method were defined as
```java
public void foo(Dog someDog) {
    someDog.setName("Max");     // AAA
    someDog = new Dog("Fifi");  // BBB
    someDog.setName("Rowlf");   // CCC
}
```
let's look at what's happening.the parameter ```someDog``` is set to the value 42 at line "AAA" ```someDog``` is followed to the ```Dog``` it points to (the Dog object at address 42) that ```Dog``` (the one at address 42) is asked to change his name to ```Max``` at line "BBB" a new ```Dog``` is created. Let's say he's at address 74 we assign the parameter ```someDog``` to 74 at line "CCC" someDog is followed to the Dog it points to (the Dog object at address 74)
that ```Dog``` (the one at address 74) is asked to change his name to ```Rowlf``` then, we return
Now let's think about what happens outside the method:

Did ```myDog``` change?

There's the key.

Keeping in mind that ```myDog``` is a pointer, and not an actual ```Dog```, the answer is NO. ```myDog``` still has the value 42; it's still pointing to the original ```Dog``` (but note that because of line "AAA", its name is now "Max" - still the same ```Dog```; ```myDog's``` value has not changed.)

It's perfectly valid to follow an address and change what's at the end of it; that does not change the variable, however.
Java works exactly like C. You can assign a pointer, pass the pointer to a method, follow the pointer in the method and change the data that was pointed to. However, you cannot change where that pointer points.

* Remember JAVA has primitive types and reference types. ```boolean, byte, short ,char, int, long, float, double``` are primitive types, everything else are reference types. The variable of reference types hold the location of an object i.e objects reference and not its value.
