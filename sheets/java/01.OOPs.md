  ## Classes
   ### Nested Classes
  * Check [this](https://javaconceptoftheday.com/nested-classes-in-java/)
  * A class within a class in called nested class.
  * They enable you to logically group classes that are only used in one place, thus this increases the use of encapsulation.
  * The scope of a nested class is bounded by the scope of its enclosing class.
  * Nested class has access to the members, including private members, of the class in which it is nested. However, reverse is not true i.e. the enclosing class does not have access to the members of the nested class.
  * Since a nested class is also a member of its enclosing class , **it can be declared private, public, protected or default** (Unlike classes which can not be private or protected).
  
  
  * Nested classes can be of two types:
   * [static nested classes](#static-classes)
   * non-static classes
    1.  Member Inner class
    2.  Anonymous Inner class
    3.  Local Inner class
   
   #### Non static Member Inner classes
   
   * It is a class which is created inside a class, but not inside a method.
   * The java compiler creates two class files in case of inner class. The class file name of inner class is ```"Outer$Inner"```. **If you want to instantiate inner class, you must have to create the instance of outer class**. In such case, instance of inner class is created inside the instance of outer class.
   * To instantiate an inner class, you must first instantiate the outer class. Then, create the inner object within the outer object with this syntax:
   
   ```java
   OuterClass.InnerClass innerObject = outerObject.new InnerClass();
   ```
   
  * Syntax: 
  ```java
  class OuterClass
{
...
    class NestedClass
    {
        ...
    }
}
  ```

* Example: 

```java
class Outer{  
 private int data=30;  
 class Inner{  
  void msg(){System.out.println("data is "+data);}  
 }  
 public static void main(String args[]){  
  Outer outerObj=new Outer();  
  Outer.Inner in=outerObj.new Inner();  
  in.msg();  
 }  
}  
```

OUTPUT: 
```java
data is 30
```


#### Local Inner Classes

* Local Inner Classes are the inner classes that are defined inside a block. This block can be either a method body, initialization block, for loop or even an if statement..The scope of local inner class will be restricted to the block they are defined in.
* Local Inner classes are not a member of any enclosing classes. They belong to the block they are defined within, due of which local inner classes cannot have any access modifiers associated with them.
* **Local Inner class cannot be declared as static**. Inner classes are associated with the block they are defined within and not with the external class(Outer in this case).
* However, **they can be marked as final or abstract**. If they are marked abstract, then all the abstract methods inside the class needs to be implemented by the class which will extend it(The inherited class also needs to be in same scope).If you declare it as final , no class in the scope of this class can override it.
* Also, feel free to extend these 
* If you want to instantiate such local inner classes, it must be done in the block they are defined in (same scope).
* These class have access to the fields of the class enclosing it. 
* Till JDK 7,Local inner class can access only final local variable of the enclosing block. However From JDK 8, it is possible to access the non-final local variable of enclosing block in local inner class.

* Exaple: 
```java
public class Outer
{
    private void getValue()
    {
        // Note that local variable(sum) must be final till JDK 7 
        // hence this code will work only in JDK 8
        int sum = 20;
         
        // Local inner Class inside method
        class Inner
        {
            public int divisor;
            public int remainder;
             
            public Inner()
            {
                divisor = 4;
                remainder = sum%divisor;
            }
            private int getDivisor()
            {
                return divisor;
            }
            private int getRemainder()
            {
                return sum%divisor;
            }
            private int getQuotient()
            {
                System.out.println("Inside inner class");
                return sum / divisor;
            }
        }
         
        Inner inner = new Inner();
        System.out.println("Divisor = "+ inner.getDivisor());
        System.out.println("Remainder = " + inner.getRemainder());
        System.out.println("Quotient = " + inner.getQuotient());
    }
     
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        Outer outer = new Outer();
        outer.getValue();
    }
}

```
OUTPUT:
```java
Divisor = 4
Remainder = 0
Inside inner class
Quotient = 5
```

* Another example:

```java
public class Outer
{
    public int data = 10;
    public int getData()
    {
        return data;
    }
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        Outer outer = new Outer();
        if(outer.getData() < 20)
        {
            // Local inner class inside if clause
            class Inner
            {
                public int getValue()
                {
                    System.out.println("Inside Inner class");
                    return outer.data;
                }
            }
  
            Inner inner = new Inner();
            System.out.println(inner.getValue());
        }
        else
        {
            System.out.println("Inside Outer class");
        }
    }
}
```
OUTPUT:
```java
Inside Inner class
10
```

## Anonymous Classes

* It is an inner **class without a name** and for which **only a single object is created**. 
* Anonymous inner classes are useful in writing implementation classes for listener interfaces. Like onclick listeners in android.
* Lets understand it using an example:

```java
//Java program to demonstrate need for Anonymous Inner class
interface Age
{
    int x = 21;
    void getAge();
}
// Myclass implement the methods of Age Interface
class MyClass implements Age
{
    @Override
    public void getAge() 
    {
        // printing the age
        System.out.print("Age is "+x);
    }
}

class AnonymousDemo
{
    public static void main(String[] args) 
    {
        // Myclass is implementation class of Age interface
        MyClass obj=new MyClass();
 
        // calling getage() method implemented at Myclass
        obj.getAge();     
    }
}
```
* In the program, interface ```Age``` is created with ```getAge()``` method and ```x=21```.  ```Myclass``` is written as implementation class of ```Age``` interface. And we finally instantiate it in  ```AnonymousDemo```.

* We don't need to create ```Myclass``` if its not going to be used again. So we can use it like:
```java
interface Age
{
    int x = 21;
    void getAge();
}
class AnonymousDemo
{
    public static void main(String[] args) {
 
        // Myclass is hidden inner class of Age interface
        // whose name is not written but an object to it 
        // is created.
        Age oj1 = new Age() {
            @Override
            public void getAge() {
                 // printing  age
                System.out.print("Age is "+x);
            }
        };
        oj1.getAge();
    }
}

```

* Based on declaration and behaviour, there are three kinds of anonymous classes. Lets take the example of ```Thread``` class and ```Runnable``` interface to understand this. ```Runnable``` interface looks something like this:

```java
public interface Runnable {
    public abstract void run();
}
```
And a thread class looks something like this:

```java
public class Thread implements Runnable {
//Other things
 @Override
    public void run() {
        if (target != null) {
            target.run();
        }
    }
// Other things    
}
```

We know there are two ways to create our own thread in JAVA. One way is to extend ```Thread``` class and override ```run()```.This is done something like this:
```java
class Runner extends Thread {
 @Override
    public void run() {
    	System.out.println("Thread initialized.");
    }
}

public class Driver {
  
    public static void main(String[] args) {
	Thread runner = new Runner();
        runner.start();

    }
}

```
We can replace ```Runner``` with an anonymous class. Which is our first type:
* **Anonymous class that extends a class**We can have an anonymous inner class that extends a class. It would look like this:

```java
public class Driver {
  
    public static void main(String[] args) {
	Thread thread = new Thread(){
            @Override
            public void run() {
                super.run();
		System.out.println("Thread initialized.");
            }
        };

        thread.start();

    }
}

```
Another way to start a thread is to implement the interface ```Runnable``` and override ```run()```. Then we can pass this as a parameter to constructor of  Thread class. Its implemented like this:

```java
 class MyRunnable implements Runnable{

        @Override
        public void run() {
            System.out.println("Thread initialized");
        }
 }
 
 public class Driver {
  
    public static void main(String[] args) {
	MyRunnable runnable = new MyRunnable();
	Thread thread = new Thread(runnable);
        thread.start();
    }
}
```

We can alse replace the above implementation with anonymous class, which is our second type:

* **Anonymous Inner class that implements a interface**: We can also have an anonymous inner class that implements an interface. It would look something like this:

```java
 public class Driver {
  
    public static void main(String[] args) {
	MyRunnable runnable = new Runnable() {
            @Override
            public void run() {
		 System.out.println("Thread initialized");
            }
        };
	Thread thread = new Thread(runnable);
        thread.start();
    }
}

```

If you look closely at above example, The ```Thread``` class defines a constructor which takes ```Runnable``` as a parameter to initialize itself. Instead of above way, we can also create an anonymous subclass of ```Thread``` which defines a constructor argument of type ```Runnable```. This is our third type of anonymous class:

* **Anonymous Inner class that defines inside method/constructor argument**:
```java
 public class Driver {
  
    public static void main(String[] args) {
	
        Thread thread = new Thread(new Runnable() {
            @Override
            public void run() {
		System.out.println("Thread initialized");
            }
        });
        thread.start();
       
    }
}
```
#### Some notes on anonymous classes:
* A normal class can implement any number of interfaces but **anonymous inner class can implement only one interface at a time**.
* A regular class can extend a class and implement any number of interface simultaneously. But **anonymous Inner class can extend a class or can implement an interface but not both at a time**.
* For regular/normal class, we can write any number of constructors but we cant write any constructor for anonymous Inner class because anonymous class does not have any name and while defining constructor class name and constructor name must be same.
* An anonymous class has access to the members of its enclosing class.
* **An anonymous class cannot access local variables in its enclosing scope that are not declared as final** or effectively final.
* 

  
## Access Modifiers 
  * The The access modifiers in java specifies accessibility (scope) of a class,method,constructor or data member.
  * In java we have four access modifiers:
  1. private
  2. default
  3. protected
  4. public
  
  * **Private** : The scope of private modifier is limited to the class only.
   1. Private Data members and methods are only accessible within the class
   2. Class and Interface **cannot** be declared as private
   3. If a class has private constructor then you cannot create the object of that class from outside of the class.
   
  Example: 
  ```java
class A{  
private int data=40;  
private void msg(){System.out.println("Hello java");}  
}  
  
public class Simple{  
 public static void main(String args[]){  
   A obj=new A();  
   System.out.println(obj.data);//Compile Time Error  
   obj.msg();//Compile Time Error  
   }  
}  
  ```
  For private constructors:
  ```java
class A{  
private A(){}//private constructor  
void msg(){System.out.println("Hello java");}  
}  
public class Simple{  
 public static void main(String args[]){  
   A obj=new A();//Compile Time Error  
 }  
}  
  ```
  
 * **Default** :When we do not mention any access modifier, it is called default access modifier.The scope of this modifier is limited to the package only. This means that if we have a class with the default access modifier in a package, only those classes that are in this package can access this class. No other class outside this package can access this class. Similarly, if we have a default method or data member in a class, it would not be visible in the class of another package.
 
 Example:
 
 ```java
package pack;  
class A{  
  void msg(){System.out.println("Hello");}  
}  
 ```
 
 ```java
package mypack;  
import pack.*;  
class B{  
  public static void main(String args[]){  
   A obj = new A();//Compile Time Error  
   obj.msg();//Compile Time Error  
  }  
}  
 ```
 
 * **protected** Protected data members and methods are only accessible by the classes of the same package and the subclasses present in any package.
 * **Classes cannot be declared protected.**
 Example:
 ```java
package pack;  
public class A{  
protected void msg(){System.out.println("Hello");}  
}  
 ```
 
 ```java
 package mypack;  
import pack.*;  
  
class B extends A{  
  public static void main(String args[]){  
   B obj = new B();  
   obj.msg();  
  }  
}  
 ```
 OUTPUT: 
 ```java
 Hello
 ```
 
 * **public** The members, methods and classes that are declared public can be accessed from anywhere. This modifier doesn’t put any restriction on the access.
 
 Example: 
 ```java
package pack;  

public class A{  
public void msg(){System.out.println("Hello");}  
}
```

```java
package mypack;  
import pack.*;  
  
class B{  
  public static void main(String args[]){  
   A obj = new A();  
   obj.msg();  
  }  
}  
```
  
| Access Modifier | within class | within package | outside package by subclass only | outside package |
|-----------------|--------------|----------------|----------------------------------|-----------------|
| Private         | Y            | N              | N                                | N               |
| Default         | Y            | Y              | N                                | N               |
| Protected       | Y            | Y              | Y                                | N               |
| Public          | Y            | Y              | Y                                | Y               |
  
  
   ## static keyword
  * *static* is a non-access modifier in Java which is applicable for the following:
   1. blocks
   2. variables
   3. methods
   4. nested classes
   
   * **When a member is declared static, it can be accessed before any objects of its class are created**, and without reference to any object.This is because, a static member belongs to a class and not to a instance of class. For example, in below java program, we are accessing static method ```m1()``` without creating any object of Test class.
   
  ```java
  class Test
{
    // static method
    static void m1()
    {
        System.out.println("from m1");
    }
 
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
          // calling m1 without creating
          // any object of class Test
           m1();
    }
}

  ```
  From outside the class:
  ```java
   class A
{
 
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
          // calling m1 without creating
          // any object of class Test
           Test.m1();
    }
}
  ```
  * **This is the reason why ```main()``` method in JAVA are static, because it needs to be invoked before any objects of that class are created.**
  
  
  	### static blocks

* static blocks (also called static clause) can be used for static initializations of a class. This code inside static block is executed only once:the first time a class is loaded by JVM (typically, when a static member of class is accessed or when a instance of the class is created). For example: 
```java
public class Test {
    static int a = 10;
    static int b;

    static {
        System.out.println("Static block intialized");
        b = a*4;
    }
    public static void main(String [] args){
       
    }
}
```

Output:
```java
Static Block Intialized
```

The above class is loaded because JVM has to access this class' ```main()```. For following code: 

```java
public class Test {
    static int a = 10;
    static int b;

    static {
        System.out.println("Static block intialized");
        b = a*4;
    }
}

public class Main {
    public  static void main(String [] args){
        System.out.println("a: "+Test.a);
        System.out.println("b:  "+Test.b);
    }
}

```
Output: 
```java
Static block intialized
a: 10
b:  40
```
* Also static blocks are initialized before constructors. See the output for the following example:

```java
public class Test {
    static int a = 10;
    static int b;

    static {
        System.out.println("Test Static block intialized");
        b = a*4;
    }

    Test(){
        System.out.println("Test Constructor initialized");
        a *= 2;
        b *= 2;
    }
}

public class Main {
    public  static void main(String [] args){

        System.out.println("a: "+Test.a);
        System.out.println("b:  "+Test.b);

        Test test = new Test();

        System.out.println("a: "+Test.a);
        System.out.println("b: "+Test.b);
    }

}
```
OUTPUT:
```java
Test Static block intialized
a: 10
b:  40
Test Constructor initialized
a: 20
b: 80
```

* Static blocks are also executed only once. IN the following code, it can seen that the static block is executed only once, as soon as the class is loaded. 
```java
class Test {
    static int i;
    int j;
    static {
        i = 10;
        System.out.println("Test Static block intialized");
    }
    Test(){
        System.out.println("Test Constructor initialized");
    }
}
 
class Main {
    public static void main(String args[]) {
 
       // Although we have two objects, static block is executed only once.
       Test t1 = new Test();
       Test t2 = new Test();
    }
}
```

OUTPUT: 
```java
Test Static block intialized
Test Constructor initialized
Test Constructor initialized
```
* Static blocks are called when class is loaded by the JVM into memory. Once class is loaded , it is there in memory , it is not loaded again and again, hence static blocks are called only once. 

* **Multiple static blocks**: Classes can have multiple static blocks in java. They execute in the given order which means the first static block executes before second static block.

Example:

```java
class JavaExample2{
   static int num;
   static String mystr;
   //First Static block
   static{
      System.out.println("Static Block 1");
      num = 68;
      mystr = "Block1";
  } 
  //Second static block
  static{
      System.out.println("Static Block 2");
      num = 98;
      mystr = "Block2";
  }
  public static void main(String args[])
  {
      System.out.println("Value of num: "+num);
      System.out.println("Value of mystr: "+mystr);
   }
}
```

OUTPUT: 
```java
Static Block 1
Static Block 2
Value of num: 98
Value of mystr: Block2
```

* **static blocks with inheritance** Consider the following code:

```java
class A {
    static {
        System.out.println("loading A static 1");
    }
    static {
        System.out.println("loading A static 2 B.c= "+B.c);        
    }
    static {
        System.out.println("loading static 3");
    }
    static int a=10; 
    A(){        
    }
}

class B extends A{
    static {
       System.out.println("loading B A.a= "+A.a);
    }
    static int c = 50;
}
public class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        new B();
    }
}

```
Output of the above code will be:

```java
loading A static 1
loading A static 2 B.c= 0
loading static 3
loading B A.a= 10
```

* To understand the above output, lets understand how classes with inheritance are loaded by JVM.
	1. If a class has already been loaded, return the class
	2. Load the parent class first.
	3. Try and load the class itself.
	
* We can check this by executing it with java -verbose Test:
```java
...
[Loaded A from file:/.../src/main/java/]
[Loaded B from file:/.../src/main/java/]
loading A static 1
loading A static 2 B.c= 0
loading static 3
loading B A.a= 10
...
```
 * **Constructors, Inheritance and static blocks** Consider following snippet of code: 
 
```java
public class Parent {    
    public Parent() {
        System.out.println("Parent Constructor");
    }    
    static {
        System.out.println("Parent static block");    
    }    
  
}

public class Child extends Parent {    
    static {
        System.out.println("Child static block");
    }

    public Child() {
        System.out.println("Child Constructor");
    }    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        new Child();    
    }
}
```

OUTPUT of the following code will be: 

```java
Parent static block
Child static block
Parent Constructor
Child Constructor
```

* This is what is going on:
 1. Parent class is loaded first by Java.
 2. As soon as the parent class is loaded, its static block will be executed.
 3. Then the child class will be loaded.
 4. As soon as the child class is loaded, its static block will be executed.
 5. ```main()``` of ```Child``` is invoked.
 6. constructor of ```Child``` is called. 
 7. constructor of ```Child``` first calls the constructor of its super class, implicitly.
 8. So constructor of ```Parent``` is exceucted first, then constructor of ```Child``` class.
 
 
   	### static variables
 * When a variable is declared as static, then a single copy of variable is created and shared among all objects at class level.  
 * Static variables are, essentially, global variables, so **there can be no local static variables**.
 * All instances of the class share the same static variable, that is why (unlike non-static variables) **such variables can be accessed directly in static and non-static methods**.
 * static method directly accessing static variables:
 ```java
 class JavaExample3{
  static int var1;
  static String var2;
  //This is a Static Method
  static void disp(){
      System.out.println("Var1 is: "+var1);
      System.out.println("Var2 is: "+var2);
  }
  public static void main(String args[]) 
  {
      disp();
  }
}
 ```
 
 OUTPUT:
 ```java
Var1 is: 0
Var2 is: null
 ```
 
 * non-static methods accessing static variables:
```java
public class Test {
    static int a = 10;
    static int b;

   static void display(){
       System.out.println("display:" + a);
   }

   //non static method accessing the static variable
    // they can access static methods as well.
   void nonStaticDisplay(){
       System.out.println("nonStaticDisplay:" +a);
   }

   public static void main(String[] args){
       //Creating instance of Test class and accessing the class' static variable through an instance
       Test obj  = new Test();
       obj.nonStaticDisplay();

       System.out.println("Test.a: "+ Test.a);
       Test.display();
       //When an instance changes the value of a static variable,
       // it actually changes the value for everyone, because this variable belongs to class.
       obj.a = 1000;

       System.out.println("obj.a:"+obj.a);
       System.out.println("Test.a: "+Test.a);
       Test.display();
   }
}

```
OUTPUT:
```java
nonStaticDisplay:10
Test.a: 10
display:10
obj.a:1000
Test.a: 1000
display:1000
```
It can be seen from the above example, that when an object changes the value of a static variable, the value of that variable changes for all objects, it makes sense because the members belong to the class and all objects access the same variable.

* As shown above, **Static variables are shared among all the instances of class**. Lets have another look: 
```java
class JavaExample{
   //Static integer variable
   static int var1=77; 
   //non-static string variable
   String var2;

   public static void main(String args[])
   {
	JavaExample ob1 = new JavaExample();
	JavaExample ob2 = new JavaExample();
	/* static variables can be accessed directly without
	 * any instances. Just to demonstrate that static variables
	 * are shared, I am accessing them using objects so that 
	 * we can check that the changes made to static variables
	 * by one object, reflects when we access them using other
	 * objects
	 */
        //Assigning the value to static variable using object ob1
	ob1.var1=88;
	ob1.var2="I'm Object1";
        /* This will overwrite the value of var1 because var1 has a single 
         * copy shared among both the objects.
         */
        ob2.var1=99;
	ob2.var2="I'm Object2";
	System.out.println("ob1 integer:"+ob1.var1);
	System.out.println("ob1 String:"+ob1.var2);
	System.out.println("ob2 integer:"+ob2.var1);
	System.out.println("ob2 STring:"+ob2.var2);
   }
}

```
OUTPUT: 
```java
ob1 integer:99
ob1 String:I'm Object1
ob2 integer:99
ob2 STring:I'm Object2
```
* In this example, String variable is non-static and integer variable is Static. As you can see in the output that the non-static variable is different for both the objects but the static variable is shared among them, thats the reason the changes made to the static variable by object ob2 reflects in both the objects.

* **static block and static variables are executed in order they are present in a program,as soon as the class is loaded by JVM** Static variables are initialized when class is loaded, they are initialized before any object of that class is created, they are initialized before any static method of the class executes.
Check the below snippet:

```java
class Test
{
    // static variable
    static int a = m1();
     
    // static block
    static {
        System.out.println("Inside static block");
    }
     
    // static method
    static int m1() {
        System.out.println("from m1");
        return 20;
    }
     
    // static method(main !!)
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
       System.out.println("Value of a : "+a);
       System.out.println("from main");
    }
 
 
}
```
OUTPUT:
```java
from m1
Inside static block
Value of a : 20
from main
```
* **static final variables** The static final variables are constants. Check below snippets:
```java
public class MyClass{
   public static final int MY_VAR=27;
}
```
* The above code will execute as soon as the class ```MyClass``` is loaded, before static method is called and even before any static variable can be accessed. The variable ```MY_VAR``` is public which means any class can use it. It is a static variable so you won’t need any object of class in order to access it. It’s final so the value of this variable can never be changed in the current or in any class.

  ### static methods
  
* Here are some points of observation:
  	1. Non-static methods and non-static variables can only be accessed using object (instance) of the class.
	2. Static methods and variables can be accessed directly without creating the objects.
	3. Static methods can access other static variables without using object.
	4. But for static methods to access non-static methods and variables, instance of the class is required.
* For example, static method ```main()``` accesses the static variables directly here:
  
  ```java
  class JavaExample{
   static int i = 10;
   static String s = "Beginnersbook";
   //This is a static method
   public static void main(String args[]) 
   {
       System.out.println("i:"+i);
       System.out.println("s:"+s);
   }
}
  ```
  OUTPUT: 
  ```java
i:10
s:Beginnersbook
  ```
 * In below example, Static method  is accessed directly in static and non-static method

```java
class JavaExample{
  static int i = 100;
  static String s = "Beginnersbook";
  //Static method
  static void display()
  {
     System.out.println("i:"+i);
     System.out.println("i:"+s);
  }

  //non-static method
  void funcn()
  {
      //Static method called in non-static method
      display();
  }
  //static method
  public static void main(String args[])
  {
	  JavaExample obj = new JavaExample();
	  //You need to have object to call this non-static method
	  obj.funcn();
	  
      //Static method called in another static method
      display();
   }
}
```

OUTPUT:

```java
i:100
i:Beginnersbook
i:100
i:Beginnersbook
```

#### static classes

* Refer [Nested classes](#nested-classes) 
* **A class can be made static only if it is a nested class.**
* As with class methods and variables, a static nested class is associated with its outer class. And like static methods, a static nested class cannot refer directly to instance variables or methods defined in its enclosing class: it can use them only through an object reference.
* They are accessed using the enclosing class name, similar to non-static inner classes.Like: 
```java
OuterClass.StaticNestedClass
```
* However unlike non-static inner classes,to create an object of a nested static class, you do not need the object of parent class.:
```java
//static inner classes do not need its parent class object to be created.
OuterClass.StaticNestedClass nestedObject = new OuterClass.StaticNestedClass();
```
* Remember object of non-static class was created like this:
```java
OuterClass outerObject = new OuterObject();
//non-static inner classes need an object of parent class, to which they belong to for creating the class.
OuterClass.InnerClass innerObject = outerObject.new InnerClass();
```
* For example: 
```java
class OuterClass
{ 
    // static member
    static int outer_x = 10;
     
    // instance(non-static) member
    int outer_y = 20;
     
    // private member
    private static int outer_private = 30;
     
    // static nested class
    static class StaticNestedClass
    {
        void display()
        {
            // can access static member of outer class
            System.out.println("outer_x = " + outer_x);
             
            // can access display private static member of outer class
            System.out.println("outer_private = " + outer_private);
             
            // The following statement will give compilation error
            // as static nested class cannot directly access non-static membera
            // System.out.println("outer_y = " + outer_y);
         
        }
    }
}


public class StaticNestedClassDemo
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        // accessing a static nested class.
        OuterClass.StaticNestedClass nestedObject = new OuterClass.StaticNestedClass();
         
        nestedObject.display();
         
    }
}
```

OUTPUT:

```java
outer_x = 10
outer_private = 30
```
* Static nested classes do not directly have access to other members(non-static variables and methods) of the enclosing class because as it is static, it must access the non-static members of its enclosing class through an object. That is, it cannot refer to non-static members of its enclosing class directly. Because of this restriction, static nested classes are seldom used.
* Non-static nested classes (inner classes) has access to all members(static and non-static variables and methods, including private) of its outer class and may refer to them directly in the same way that other non-static members of the outer class do.
