## Strings

* A Java String is an **object** of the class ```java.lang```.
* Java's String is designed to be **in between a primitive and a class**, for performance reasons.
* Strings receive this special treatment because they are used frequently in a program.Hence efficiency in terms of computation and storage is crucial.
* The designers of Java decided to retain primitive types in an object-oriented language, instead of making everything an object, so as to improve the performance of the language. Primitives are stored in the **call stack**, which require less storage spaces and are cheaper to manipulate. On the other hand, objects are stored in the **program heap**, which require complex memory management and more storage spaces.

### String Literal vs String Object

* A string can be constructed by either: 
  * directly assigning a string literal to a String reference - *just like a primitive*, or
  * via the "new" operator and constructor, *similar to any other classes* . However, this is not commonly-used and is not recommended.
Example:
```java
String str1 = "Java is Hot";           // Implicit construction via string literal
String str2 = new String("I'm cool");  // Explicit construction via new
```
* In the first statement, ```str1``` is declared as a String reference and initialized with a string literal ```"Java is Hot"```. In the second statement, ```str2``` is declared as a String reference. Here  a new memory location is created which contains ```"I'm cool"```, and the reference to this memory location is provided to ```str2```.

* String literals are stored in a *common pool*. This facilitates sharing of storage for strings with the same contents to conserve storage. String objects allocated via new operator are stored in the heap, and there is no sharing of storage for the same contents.

Lets have a look at following example:

```java
String s1 = "Hello";              // String literal
String s2 = "Hello";              // String literal
String s3 = s1;                   // same reference
String s4 = new String("Hello");  // String object
String s5 = new String("Hello");  // String object
```

* Java has provided a special mechanism for keeping the String literals - in a so-called **string common pool**. If two string literals have the same contents, they will share the same storage inside the common pool. This approach is adopted to conserve storage for frequently-used strings. 

* On the other hand, String objects created via the new operator and constructor are kept in the heap. **Each String object in the heap has its own storage just like any other object**. There is no sharing of storage in heap even if two String objects have the same contents.

Look at the following illustration:

### equals() and == operator

* ```==``` (equality operator) is a binary operator used to compare primitives and objects.  In case of primitives, ```==``` this checks the value of two operands. It returns true if value of both the operands are same. And for objects, checks the value (i.e., memory address in the heap) of the two objects. Thus ```==``` returns true only if the references of the objects being compared refer to the same object instance.Since Java doesnâ€™t support operator overloading, ```==``` behaves identical for every object.

* Apart from the primitives, everything in Java is an object which is extended by the Java.lang.Object.  ```equals()``` other method is  defined in the ```Object``` class. So all java classes have the ```equals()``` method by default. If the ```equals()``` method is not overridden, the default implementation of the equals method() inherited from the Object class will be used. **The default implementation of ```equals()``` checks if the object references of the two objects being compared are equal, that is if both the objects being compared are the exact same object.**  It is recommended to override this method if we wish to compare the objects to test their equality based on the business requirements.

Default implementation of  ```equals()``` in ```Object``` class:

```java
public boolean equals(Object obj) {
        return (this == obj);
    }
```

* Lets have a look at overridden implementation of ```equals()``` in ```String```:

```java
  public boolean equals(Object anObject) {
        if (this == anObject) {
            return true;
        }
        if (anObject instanceof String) {
            String aString = (String)anObject;
            if (coder() == aString.coder()) {
                return isLatin1() ? StringLatin1.equals(value, aString.value)
                                  : StringUTF16.equals(value, aString.value);
            }
        }
        return false;
   }
```
* The above method, compares the current string to the specified object. The result is true if and only if the argument is not NULL and is a ```String``` object that represents the same sequence of characters as this object. So essentially it checks for the contents of the two Strings.

* For the example discussed above, 

```java
String s1 = "Hello";              // String literal
String s2 = "Hello";              // String literal
String s3 = s1;                   // same reference
String s4 = new String("Hello");  // String object
String s5 = new String("Hello");  // String object
```

```equals()``` and ```==``` behave something like this:

```java
s1 == s1;         // true, same pointer
s1 == s2;         // true, s1 and s1 share storage in common pool
s1 == s3;         // true, s3 is assigned same pointer as s1
s1.equals(s3);    // true, same contents
s1 == s4;         // false, different pointers
s1.equals(s4);    // true, same contents
s4 == s5;         // false, different pointers in heap
s4.equals(s5);    // true, same contents
```

* **NOTE**
 * It is a logical error to use ```(str1 == str2)``` in your program to compare the contents of two Strings, Use ```equals()``` method.
 * String can be created by directly assigning a String literal which is shared in a common pool. It is not recommended to use the ```new``` operator to construct a String object in the heap.


### + operator

* The ```+``` operator, which performs addition on primitives (such as int and double), is **overloaded** to operate on String objects. ```+``` performs concatenation for two String operands.

* Unlike C++, Java does not support operator overloading for software engineering consideration.The '+' operator is the only operator that is internally overloaded to support string concatenation in Java. Take note that '+' does not work on any two arbitrary objects.

### String is immutable

* Since string literals with the same contents share storage in the common pool, Java's String is designed to be immutable.
* That is, once a String is constructed, its contents cannot be modified. Otherwise, the other String references sharing the same storage location will be affected by the change, which can be unpredictable and therefore is undesirable. 
* So what happens when we try to make changes to existing string? Once we create a String object, we can't perform any changes in the existing object. If we try to do so, a new object will be created. (this non-changeable behaviour is known as Immutability in java.)
* Methods such as ```toUpperCase()``` might appear to modify the contents of a String object but actually, a completely new String object is created and returned to the caller. The original String object will be deallocated, once there is no more references, and subsequently garbage-collected.

* Consider the following example:

```java
String str = "Hello";
for (int i = ;0 i < 1000; ++i) {
   str = str + i;
}
```

* The above code creates 1000 new Strings in the String pool to store these values. Because of this it is not efficient to use String if you need to modify your string frequently (that would create many new Strings occupying new storage areas).

* If the contents of a String have to be modified frequently, use the ```StringBuffer``` or ```StringBuilder``` class instead.

## StringBuffer and String Builder

* String literals with same content share the same storage in the string common pool. Modifying the content of one String directly may cause adverse side-effects to other Strings sharing the same storage. Hence Strings are made immutable. i.e. values of string once assigned, can not be changed. If a new value is assigned a new object is created and returned.

* For mutable purposes, JDK provides two classes to support mutable strings: ```StringBuffer``` and``` StringBuilder``` (in core package java.lang)

* A ```StringBuffer``` or ```StringBuilder``` object is just like any ordinary object, which are stored in the heap and not shared, and therefore, can be modified without causing adverse side-effect to other objects.

* ```StringBuilder``` is the same as ```StringBuffer``` class, except that **```StringBuilder``` is *not synchronized* for multithread operations**. However, for single-thread program, StringBuilder is more efficient(without the synchronization overhead).

* **NOTE:** Strings are more efficient if they are not modified (because they are shared in the string common pool). However, if you have to modify the content of a string frequently (such as a status message), you should use the StringBuffer class (or the StringBuilder described below) instead.

### java.lang.StringBuffer

* ```StringBuffer``` is an ordinary object. You need to use a constructor to create a StringBuffer (instead of assigning to a String literal). Furthermore, '+' operator does not apply to objects, including the StringBuffer.  Use ```append()``` instead.
* For example: if we create a string of YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS, we can do it in two ways:

```java
String anotherDataStr = year + "-" + month + "-" + day + " " + hour + ":" + minute + ":" + second;
System.out.println(anotherDataStr);
```
For operations like this, where we create strings from parts, it is more efficient to use ```StringBuffer```(multi-threaded environment) or ```StringBuilder```(single-thread environment).Like:

```java
// Create a string of YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS
int year = 2010, month = 10, day = 10;
int hour = 10, minute = 10, second = 10;
String dateStr = new StringBuilder()
      .append(year).append("-").append(month).append("-").append(day).append(" ")
      .append(hour).append(":").append(minute).append(":").append(second).toString();
System.out.println(dateStr);
```

* Infact, if you are thinking , how does JDK handle string concatenation via the '+' operator, JDK actually uses ```StringBuffer``` to do so: 

```java
String msg = "a" + "b" + "c";
```
will be compiled to:

```java
String msg = new StringBuffer().append("a").append("b").append("c").toString();
```
Here, two objects are created during the process, an intermediate StringBuffer object and the returned String object.

 ### java.lang.StringBuilder
 
 * JDK 1.5 introduced a new ```StringBuilder``` class (in package java.lang), which is almost identical to the ```StringBuffer``` class, except that **it is not synchronized**. In other words, if multiple threads are accessing a ```StringBuilder``` instance at the same time, its integrity cannot be guaranteed. However, for a single-thread program (most commonly), doing away with the overhead of synchronization makes the ```StringBuilder``` faster.

* ```StringBuilder``` is API-compatible with the ```StringBuffer``` class, i.e., having the same set of constructors and methods, but with no guarantee of synchronization. It can be a drop-in replacement for ```StringBuffer``` under a single-thread environment.
