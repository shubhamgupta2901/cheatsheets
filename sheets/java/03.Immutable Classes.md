  ## What is an immutable object
  
  * An immutable object is one that will not change state after it is instantiated.
  * An object is immutable if its state cannot change after construction. Immutable objects don’t expose any way for other objects to modify their state; 
    the object’s fields are initialized only once inside the constructor and never change again.
  * An immutable object can’t be modified after it has been created. When a new value is needed, the accepted practice is to make a copy of the object that has the new value.
  * In Java, all the wrapper classes (like String, Boolean, Byte, Short) and String class is immutable.
  
  * This is useful as it means you can pass references to the object around, without worrying that someone else is going to change its contents. 
    Especially when dealing with **concurrency** , there are no locking issues with objects that never change. 
    
  * Lets understand by example. Have a look at the following code:
 
 ```java
 class ImmutableInt {
  private final int value;

  public ImmutableInt(int i) {
    value = i;
  }

  public int getValue() {
    return value;
  }
}
 ```
 
 * As can be seen in the above example, the value of the ```ImmutableInt``` can only be set when the object is instantiated, and by having only a getter (```getValue()```) the object's state cannot be changed after instantiation.
 * But it is important to understand that since the class does not have settter methods, it is not guaranteed to be immutable. 
 getter methods, provide access to the reference of objects when they return values. So if the referenced object which is returned is not immutable itself, we provide the access to reference of the object.
 And changes can be made.
 * So, there must be care taken that all objects that are referenced by the object must be immutable as well, or it could be possible to change the state of the object.
 * For example, allowing an reference to an ```array``` or ```ArrayList``` to be obtained through an getter will allow the internal state to change by changing the ```array``` or ```Collection```:
 
 ```java
 class NotQuiteImmutableList<T> {
  private final List<T> list;

  public NotQuiteImmutableList(List<T> list) {
    // creates a new ArrayList and keeps a reference to it.
    this.list = new ArrayList(list); 
  }

  public List<T> getList() {
    return list;
  }
}
 ```
 * The problem with the above code is, that the ```ArrayList``` can be obtained through ```getList``` and be manipulated, leading to the state of the object itself to be altered, therefore, not immutable.
 
 ```java
  // notQuiteImmutableList contains "a", "b", "c"
  List<String> notQuiteImmutableList= new NotQuiteImmutableList(Arrays.asList("a", "b", "c"));
  // now the list contains "a", "b", "c", "d" -- this list is mutable.
  notQuiteImmutableList.getList().add("d");
 ```
 
 * One way to get around this problem is to return a copy of an array or collection when called from a getter:
 
```java
public List<T> getList() {
  // return a copy of the list so the internal state cannot be altered
  return new ArrayList(list);
}
```java

* Lets take another example:

```java
class Foo
{
     private final String myvar;

     public Foo(final String initialValue)
     {
         this.myvar = initialValue;
     }

     public String getValue()
     {
         return this.myvar;
     }
}
```

* Here, ```Foo``` doesn't have to worry that the caller to ```getValue()``` might change the text in the string.
* If you imagine a similar class to ```Foo```, but with a ```StringBuilder``` rather than a ```String``` as a member, you can see that a caller to ```getValue()``` would be able to alter the ```StringBuilder``` attribute of a ```Foo``` instance.
  which means we will not have an immutable object.
* 
 
 ## Differences between final and immutability
  * final is a modifier which is used for class, method and variable also.  When a variable is declared with final keyword, it’s value can’t be modified, essentially, a constant.
  * **final ensures that the address of the object remains the same whereas the Immutable suggests that we can’t change the state of the object once created**
  * final means that you can’t change the object’s reference to point to another reference or another object, **but you can still mutate its state (using setter methods)**. 
    Whereas immutable means that the object’s actual value can’t be changed, but you can change its reference to another one.
  * By declaring a reference variable as final, we **wont** get any immutability nature, Even though reference variable is final.
    But we cant perform reassignment for that variable but we can perform any type of change in the corresponding Object.
  * Lets take an example:
 
  ```java
  class Geeks {
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        final StringBuffer sb = new StringBuffer("Hello");
 
        // Even though reference varibale s1 is final
        // We can perform any changes
        sb.append("GFG");
 
        System.out.println(sb);
 
        // Here we will get Compile time error
        // Because reassignment is not possible for final variable
        sb = new StringBuffer("Hello World");
 
        System.out.println(sb);
    }
}
  ```
  
  * If you have a look at the above code, ```sb``` is a final variable, so you can not reassign a new value to ```sb```.
  * But ```sb```  has a reference of a memory location (which can't be changed as it is final). We can change the value stored at that memory location. So final is not immutable.
