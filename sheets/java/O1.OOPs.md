  ### Constructors
  * Constructor is block of code(similar to method) which is used to initialize an object. It is called when an instance of object is created (using ```new``` ) and memory is allocated to object.
  * The constructor name matches with the class name and it doesnâ€™t have a return type.
   
   #### How does constructors work?
   A default constructor in a class looks like this. A default constructor is a constructor which does not take any parameter.
  
  ```java
   public class Hello {
   String name;
   
   // Constructor
   Hello(){
      this.name = "Shubham";
   }
   
   public static void main(String[] args) {
      Hello obj = new Hello();
      System.out.println(obj.name);
   }
}
  ```
   When we create object of the above class :
  ```java
   Hello obj = new Hello(); 
  ```
  OUTPUT of ```main()```
  ```java
  Shubham
  ```
  The ```new``` keyword here creates a new object of class ```Hello``` by allocating memory. ```obj``` is then assigned the value of this memory's reference.
  The constructor is invoked in the object to initialize the values of this newly created object. So once the constructor is called the value of ```name``` in for object ```obj``` will be ```Shubham```.
  
  #### Types of Constructors 
  * **Default Constructor**  If we do not implement any constructor in our class, Java inserts a default constructor to the code in our behalf. This initializes the object's variable with default values of their respective data types.
  * Default constructors are not visible in the source code, as they are inserted at the time of compilation when you have not provided any constructor explicitly.
  * Consider the following example: 
 ```java 
  public class Hello {
   String name;
}
 ```
  Since no other constructor is provided in the class, at the time of compilation, a default constructor is provided by the compiler. So the class essentially looks something like this; 
  ```java 
  public class Employee {
   String name;
   int credits;
   boolean isActive;
   
   Employee(){
    name = null;
    credits = 0; 
    isActive = false;
   }
}
 ```
 * The default constructor is the no-argument constructor automatically generated unless you define another constructor. It initialises any uninitialised fields to their default values.
 
 * **No-argument constructor** A no-argument constructor is similar to the default constructor in a sense that it also does not take any parameter but it is explicitly defined by user.
