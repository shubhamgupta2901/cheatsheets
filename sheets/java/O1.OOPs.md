  ### Constructors
  * Constructor is block of code(similar to method) which is used to initialize an object. It is called when an instance of object is created (using ```new``` ) and memory is allocated to object.
  * The constructor name matches with the class name and it doesn’t have a return type.
   
   #### How does constructors work?
   A default constructor in a class looks like this. A default constructor is a constructor which does not take any parameter.
  
  ```java
   public class Hello {
   String name;
   
   // Constructor
   Hello(){
      this.name = "Shubham";
   }
   
   public static void main(String[] args) {
      Hello obj = new Hello();
      System.out.println(obj.name);
   }
}
  ```
   When we create object of the above class :
  ```java
   Hello obj = new Hello(); 
  ```
  OUTPUT of ```main()```
  ```java
  Shubham
  ```
  The ```new``` keyword here creates a new object of class ```Hello``` by allocating memory. ```obj``` is then assigned the value of this memory's reference.
  The constructor is invoked in the object to initialize the values of this newly created object. So once the constructor is called the value of ```name``` in for object ```obj``` will be ```Shubham```.
  
  #### Types of Constructors 
  * **Default Constructor**  If we do not implement any constructor in our class, Java inserts a default constructor to the code in our behalf. This initializes the object's variable with default values of their respective data types.
  * Default constructors are not visible in the source code, as they are inserted at the time of compilation when you have not provided any constructor explicitly.
  * If you provide a constructor to your, then the default constructor is not generated by the compiler.
  * Consider the following example: 
 ```java 
  public class Hello {
   String name;
}
 ```
  Since no other constructor is provided in the class, at the time of compilation, a default constructor is provided by the compiler. So the class essentially looks something like this; 
  ```java 
  public class Employee {
   String name;
   int credits;
   boolean isActive;
   
   Employee(){
    name = null;
    credits = 0; 
    isActive = false;
   }
}
 ```
 * The default constructor is the no-argument constructor automatically generated unless you define another constructor. It initialises any uninitialised fields to their default values.
 
 * *Why default constructor?* 
 
 * **No-argument constructor** A no-argument constructor is similar to the default constructor in a sense that it also does not take any parameter but unlike default constructor, it is explicitly defined by user.
 * Example: 
```java 
  public class Employee {
   String name;
   int credits;
   boolean isActive;
   
   Employee(){
    credits = 25; 
    isActive = true;
   }
}
```
 In the above example, use of no-argument constructor can be seen, you want all the objects created to be initialised with default values, which are different than the data type provided values. So when the objects of ```Employee``` class is created, all of them will have 25 credits and will be active, when they are initialized.
 
 * NOTE: The compiler automatically provides a no-argument, default constructor for any class without constructors. This default constructor will call the no-argument constructor of the superclass. In this situation, the compiler will complain if the superclass doesn't have a no-argument constructor so you must verify that it does. If your class has no explicit superclass, then it has an implicit superclass of Object, which does have a no-argument constructor.
 
 * **Parameterized Constructors** Constructors which take parameters are called parameterized constructor. They are used to provide different values to the distinct objects at the time of initialization.

 
 Example: 
 
 ```java
 public class Employee {

   int empId;  
   String empName;  
	    
   //parameterized constructor with two parameters
   Employee(int id, String name){  
       this.empId = id;  
       this.empName = name;  
   }  
   void info(){
        System.out.println("Id: "+empId+" Name: "+empName);
   }  
	   
   public static void main(String args[]){  
	  Employee obj1 = new Employee(10245,"Chaitanya");  
	  Employee obj2 = new Employee(92232,"Negan");  
	  obj1.info();  
	  obj2.info();  
   }  
}
 ```
 Output:
```java
Id: 10245 Name: Chaitanya
Id: 92232 Name: Negan
```

* **Constructor Overloading** Just like methods, constructors can also be overloaded. Since constructors don't have a return type, we can overloading is obtained solely on basis of difference in types and number of arguments.
So a class can have as many constructors (with different signatures) as you want.
 ```java
 class Example
{
      private int var;
      //no arg constructor
      public Example()
      {
             this.var = 10;
      }
      //parameterized constructor
      public Example(int num)
      {
             this.var = num;
      }
      public int getValue()
      {
              return var;
      }
      public static void main(String args[])
      {
              Example2 obj = new Example2();
              Example2 obj2 = new Example2(100);
              System.out.println("var is: "+obj.getValue());  //Output var is: 0
              System.out.println("var is: "+obj2.getValue()); // Output var is: 100
      }
}
 ```
 
 In the above example, we have two constructors, a default constructor and a parameterized constructor. When we do not pass any parameter while creating the object using new keyword then default constructor is invoked, however when you pass a parameter then parameterized constructor that matches with the passed parameters list gets invoked.(Compile time polymorphism or static binding.)

* *C++'s copy constructor is a parameterized constructor in Java.* There is no copy constructor in java. But, we can copy the values of one object to another like copy constructor in C++.
```java
class Student6{  
    int id;  
    String name;  
    Student6(int i,String n){  
    id = i;  
    name = n;  
    }  
      
    Student6(Student6 s){  
    id = s.id;  
    name =s.name;  
    }  
    void display(){System.out.println(id+" "+name);}  
   
    public static void main(String args[]){  
    Student6 s1 = new Student6(111,"Karan");  
    Student6 s2 = new Student6(s1);  
    s1.display();  
    s2.display();  
   }  
}  

```

Output of the above code: 
```java
111 Karan
111 Karan
```

* **When you only implement parameterized constructor?** When you don’t implement any constructor in your class, compiler inserts the default constructor into your code, however when you implement any constructor (in above example I have implemented parameterized constructor with int parameter), then you don’t receive the default constructor by compiler into your code.

Example: 
```java
class Example3
{
      private int var;
      public Example3(int num)
      {
             var=num;
      }
      public int getValue()
      {
              return var;
      }
      public static void main(String args[])
      {
              Example3 myobj = new Example3();
              System.out.println("value of var is: "+myobj.getValue());
      }
}
```

The above code generates compile time error, as it is not able to find the constructor with no arguments.If we remove the parameterized constructor from the above code then the program would run fine, because then compiler would insert the default constructor into your code.

* **We can chain constructors.** When A constructor calls another constructor of same class then this is called constructor chaining. 
* The real purpose of Constructor Chaining is that you can pass parameters through a bunch of different constructors, but only have the initialization done in a single place. This allows you to maintain your initializations from a single location, while providing multiple constructors to the user. If we don’t chain, and two different constructors require a specific parameter, you will have to initialize that parameter twice, and when the initialization changes, you’ll have to change it in every constructor, instead of just the one.
