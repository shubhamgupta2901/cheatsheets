### Introduction

* Objects are born and objects die. They have their own lifecycle which we decide. We decide when and how we **construct** it, and we decide when we **destroy** them.
* But in Java,we don't actually *destroy* them, we simply abandon them. Once these objects are abandoned, **Garbage Collector(gc)**, destroys them and reclaims the memory that the object was using. Without garbage collection, we risk running our of RAM.
* So we need to have a basic understanding about how objects are created, where they live while they are alive, and how to keep and abandon them effeciently.
* Knowing the fundamentals of the Java Stack and Heap is crucial if you want to understand variable scope, object creation issues, memory management, threads, and exception handling. 

### The Stack and the Heap

* In JAVA, we care about two areas of memory - **Heap** (*also known as garbage collectible heap*)- where objects live and **Stack** - where method invocations and local variables live.
* When a JVM starts up, it gets a chunk of memory from the underlying OS and it uses it to run our JAVA program.

* **Where variable live?** Where a variable lives depends on what kind of variable it is. By *kind* we don't mean *type* (primitive or object reference). The two kinds of variables are *Instance variables* and *local variables*. Local variables are also refered as stack variables.

* **Instance variables**: Instance variables are declared inside a class but *not* inside a method.They represent the fields that each object has, which can be filled with different values, for each instance of class. Instance variables live inside the object they belong to.Eg variables like ```size`` below:
```java
public class Duck{
  int size;
}
```

* **Local Variable**: Local variables are declared inside a method, including method parameters. They are temporary and live only as long as the method is on the stack. (In other words, as long as the method has not reached the closing curly braces.). In below snippet, the parameter ```x``` and variables ```i``` and ```b``` are all local variables. 

```java
public void foo(int x){
    int i = x+3;
    boolean b =true;
}
```

### Methods are stacked
* When we call a method, the method is pushed into the top of **call stack**. This thing which is pushed is called as *stack frame*, it holds the state of the method including the value of local variables, which line of code is executing etc.

*The method at the top of the stack is always the currently-running method for that stack. A method stays on the stack until the method hits its closing curly brace (which means the method’s done). If method ```foo()``` calls method ```bar()```, method ```bar()``` is stacked on top of method ```foo()```.

* Look at the below snippet:

```java
public void doStuff() {
   boolean b = true;
   go(4);
}
public void go(int x) {
   int z = x + 24;
   crazy();
   // imagine more code here
}
public void crazy() {
   char c = 'a';
}
```

* The code has three methods. The first method ```doStuff()``` calls the second method ```go()```, and the second method calls the third ```crazy()```. Each method declares one local variable within the body of the method, and method ```go()``` also declares a parameter variable (which means ```go()``` has two local variables).This is what happens in the call stack:
  * Code from another class calls ```doStuff()```, and ```doStuff()``` goes into a stack frame at the top of the stack.The boolean variable named ```b``` goes on the ```doStuff()``` stack frame.
  * ```doStuff()``` calls ```go()```, ```go()``` is pushed on top of the stack. Variables ```x``` and ```z``` are in the ```go()``` stack frame.
  * ```go()``` calls ```crazy()```, ```crazy()``` is now on the top of the stack, with variable ```c``` in the frame.
  * ```crazy()``` completes, and its stack frame is popped off the stack. Execution goes back to the ```go()``` method, and picks up at the line following the call to ```crazy()```.

### What about local variables that are objects?

* Remember, a non-primitive variable holds a *reference* to an object, not the object itself. We already know where objects live — on the heap. It doesn’t matter where they’re declared or created. **If the local variable is a reference to an object, only the variable (the reference/remote control) goes on the stack.The object itself still goes in the heap.**

```java
public class StackRef {
   public void foof() {
      barf();
   }

   public void barf() {
      Duck d = new Duck(24);
   }
}
```
