   ## Memory Model

![java memory model](https://github.com/shubhamgupta2901/cheatsheets/blob/master/assets/java%20memory%20model%20final.png)

* Whenever you execute a java program and JVM starts up, the operating system allocates a separate memory area to JVM to run the program. The memory block allocated to this process includes the Heap, thread stacks, meta space ets. We call this memory *Native memory*. It is the memory provided by the OS to the process, in this case the JVM itself is a process.

* JVM broadly divides the memory block provided to it in following components:
   * Heap
   * JVM Stack
   * Native Stack
   * Method area
   * Permanent generation
   * 
   
### Heap

* Heap is the area where JVM stores all the objects. Heap memory is significantly higher than stack memory. At a broad level JVM Heap is divided into two parts: Young Generation(Nursery) and Old Generation(Tenure).

* **Young Generation**: Young generation is the place where all the new objects are created. The young generation area is furthur divided into **Eden, Survivor memory S0 and Survivor Memory S1**.Here a minor gc is triggered, every time the space in young generation fills up.

* * **Old Generation** When the referenced objects live through a certain number of minor GC, the objects are moved from 'TO' survivor space to the Old Generation Space. The garbage collection that happens here is major garbage collection (**Major GC**). This is triggered when the old generation is full.

* Usually the memory available to heap is divided in the following ratio:

| Memory Type                      | Ratio                     |
|----------------------------------|---------------------------|
| **Young Generation**             | **1/3 of Heap**           |
|     Survivor Memory 1 (To)       | 1/8th of Young Generation |
|     Survivor Memory 2 (From)     | 1/8th of Young Generation |
|     Eden                         | 3/4th of Young Generation |
| **Old Generation**               | **2/3 of Heap**           |


### JVM Stack

* For every thread, JVM creates a seperate stack at the time of thread creation. The stack of currently exceucting thread is called **run-time stack**.
* Each and every method call performed by this thread is pushed in the corresponding run time stack. Each entry that is pushed in the stack is called **Stack frame** or Activation record.
* A stack frame of a method includes parameters,local variable, intermediate computations, and other data. After completing a method, corresponding entry from the stack is popped. After completing all method calls the stack becomes empty and that empty stack is destroyed by the JVM just before terminating the thread.
* The data stored in one thread is available for the corresponding thread and not available to the remaining threads. Hence we say that the **local variables are other local data is thread safe.**

### Permanent Generation

* Permanent Generation or “Perm Gen” contains the application metadata required by the JVM to describe the classes and methods used in the application.**Perm Gen is not part of Java Heap memory** 

* **With Java 8, there is no Perm Gen, it is replaced by Metaspace**. Metaspace is not part of the heap. Most allocations of the class metadata are now allocated out of native memory. Metaspace by default auto increases its size (up to what the underlying OS provides), while Perm Gen always has fixed maximum size.  The theme behind the Metaspace is that the lifetime of classes and their metadata matches the lifetime of the classloaders. That is, as long as the classloader is alive, the metadata remains alive in the Metaspace and can’t be freed.


### Method Area

### Native Stack

* A Native Method Stack stores similar data elements as a JVM Stack and it is used to help executing native (non-Java) methods.
* 

 
## Basics

* Objects are born and objects die. They have their own lifecycle which we decide. We decide when and how we **construct** it, and we decide when we **destroy** them.
* But in Java,we don't actually *destroy* them, we simply abandon them. Once these objects are abandoned, **Garbage Collector(gc)**, destroys them and reclaims the memory that the object was using. Without garbage collection, we risk running our of RAM.

### The Stack and the Heap

* When a JVM starts up, it gets a chunk of memory from the underlying OS and it uses it to run our JAVA program. 

* In JAVA, we care about two areas of memory which JVM creates for itself - **Heap** (*also known as garbage collectible heap*)- where objects live and **Stack** - where method invocations and local variables live.

* Whenever we create any object, it’s always created in the Heap space. **Garbage Collection runs only on the heap memory to free the memory used by objects that doesn’t have any reference**. Any object created in the heap space has global access and can be referenced from anywhere of the application.

* Stack memory size is very less compared to Heap memory.

### Kinds of variables

* Where a variable lives depends on what kind of variable it is. By *kind* we don't mean *type* (primitive or object reference). The two kinds of variables are **Instance variables** and **local variables**. 

* **Instance variables**: Instance variables are declared inside a class but *not* inside a method.They represent the fields that each object has, which can be filled with different values, for each instance of class. Instance variables live inside the object they belong to. Eg variables like ```size``` below:
```java
public class Duck{
  int size;
}
```

* **Local Variable**: Local variables are declared inside a method, including method parameters. They are temporary and live only as long as the method is on the stack. (In other words, as long as the method has not reached the closing curly braces.). In below snippet, the parameter ```x``` and variables ```i``` and ```b``` are all local variables. 

```java
public void foo(int x){
    int i = x+3;
    boolean b =true;
}
```

### Where do methods live
* When we call a method, the method is pushed into the top of **call stack**. This thing which is pushed is called as *stack frame*, it holds the state of the method including the value of local variables, which line of code is executing etc.

* The method at the top of the stack is always the currently-running method for that stack. A method stays on the stack until the method hits its closing curly brace (which means the method’s done). If method ```foo()``` calls method ```bar()```, method ```bar()``` is stacked on top of method ```foo()```.

* Look at the below snippet:

```java
public void doStuff() {
   boolean b = true;
   go(4);
}
public void go(int x) {
   int z = x + 24;
   crazy();
   // imagine more code here
}
public void crazy() {
   char c = 'a';
}
```

* The code has three methods. The first method ```doStuff()``` calls the second method ```go()```, and the second method calls the third ```crazy()```. Each method declares one local variable within the body of the method, and method ```go()``` also declares a parameter variable (which means ```go()``` has two local variables).This is what happens in the call stack:
  * Code from another class calls ```doStuff()```, and ```doStuff()``` goes into a stack frame at the top of the stack.The boolean variable named ```b``` goes on the ```doStuff()``` stack frame.
  * ```doStuff()``` calls ```go()```, ```go()``` is pushed on top of the stack. Variables ```x``` and ```z``` are in the ```go()``` stack frame.
  * ```go()``` calls ```crazy()```, ```crazy()``` is now on the top of the stack, with variable ```c``` in the frame.
  * ```crazy()``` completes, and its stack frame is popped off the stack. Execution goes back to the ```go()``` method, and picks up at the line following the call to ```crazy()```.

### Where do local variables live

* Local variables live inside the stack frames of the method in the stack.There scope is limited to the method and soon as the method finishes, and its stack frame is popped from the stack, the variables are also destroyed. 

* Primitive variables hold the bits that represent its value. So when a method declares or creates a primitive variable , it goes in the stack , i.e. stack frame of the method.For example, if we have following source code:

```java
public void doStuff(){
 int b;
}
```
![local primitive variable](https://github.com/shubhamgupta2901/cheatsheets/blob/master/assets/local%20primitive%20variable.jpg)

* A non-primitive variable holds a *reference* to an object, not the object itself. In other words, these variables hold the bits that represent a reference to the actual object.  Remember objects live in heap. It doesn’t matter where they’re declared or created. **If the local variable is a reference to an object, only the variable (the reference) goes on the stack.The object itself still goes in the heap.**

```java
public class StackRef {
   public void foof() {
      barf();
   }

   public void barf() {
      Duck d = new Duck(24);
   }
}
```

### Where do instance variables live

*  **Instance variables live on the Heap, inside the object they belong to.** 

```java
public class CellPhone {
  int x= 23;
}
```

* When you say new ```CellPhone()```, Java has to make space on the Heap for that ```CellPhone``` object. But how much space? Enough for the object, which means enough to house all of the object’s instance variables.

* **Primitive Instance variable**:  Values of an object’s instance variables live inside the object. If the instance variables are all primitives, Java makes space for the instance variables based on the primitive type. An ```int``` needs 32 bits, a ```long``` 64 bits, etc. Java doesn’t care about the value inside primitive variables; the bit-size of an ```int``` variable is the same (32 bits) whether the value of the ```int``` is 32,000,000 or 32.

```java
public class CellPhone {
  int x;
  long y;
}
```
![instance primitive variable](https://github.com/shubhamgupta2901/cheatsheets/blob/master/assets/instance%20primitive%20variable.jpg)

* **non-primitive Instance variables**: But what if the instance variables are references to objects? Like in our example , CellPhone has a reference variable of type Antenna.

```java
public class CellPhone {
  private Antenna ant = new Antenna();
}
```
*  Consider a use case where the object has instance variables that are object references rather than primitives, In this case too, JAVA stores their values inside the object in the heap. But remember that a **reference variable value is not the whole object, but merely a reference to the object**. The value represented by a non primitive instance variable is bits that represent a reference to actual object.So if ```CellPhone``` has an instance variable declared as the non-primitive type ```Antenna```, Java makes space within the ```CellPhone``` object only for the ```Antenna’s``` reference (i.e. reference variable) but not the ```Antenna``` object.

* Well then when does the ```Antenna``` object get space on the Heap? First we have to find out when the ```Antenna``` object itself is created. That depends on the instance variable declaration. If the instance variable is declared but no object is assigned to it, then only the space for the reference variable  is created.No actual Antenna object is made on the heap unless or until the reference variable is assigned a new Antenna object like below:

```java
public class CellPhone {
  private Antenna ant = new Antenna();
}
```
![non primitive instance variable](https://github.com/shubhamgupta2901/cheatsheets/blob/master/assets/non%20primitive%20instance%20variable.jpg)

### Object creation

* Now that we know where variables and objects live, we can understand object creation. 

* There are three steps of object declaration and assignment: 
   * declare a reference variable,
   * create an object
   * and assign the object to the reference.

* So when an object is created (because somebody said ```new```), the object gets space for all the instance variables, from all the way up the inheritance tree.  When an object is created, it’s almost as though multiple objects materialize—the object being created and one object per each superclass. But it’s much better to think of it like the picture below, where the object being created has layers of itself representing each superclass.

* So when a new object is created, only one object gets space in the heap - the one which is created.But it contains all the parts of itself, and the super class parts of itself which it inherited. All instance variables from both class have to be here.
* For example if we create instance of a class ```Hipp``` which extends ```Animal```, it always has a parent, ```Object``` class. Only one object of ```Hippo``` is created, but it contains all the parts of itself which it inherited.  

```java
public class Animal{
 Foo k;
 int x,v;
}

public class Hippo extends Animal{
 Foo X,Y;
}
```

### How long does object live

* An object’s life depends entirely on the life of references referring to it. If the reference is considered alive, the object is still alive on the Heap. If the reference dies, the object will die.

* *How long do variable live?* That depends on whether the variable is a local variable or an instance variable. The code below shows the life of a local variable. In the example, the variable is a primitive, but variable lifetime is the same whether it’s a primitive or reference variable.

![life of a local variable](https://github.com/shubhamgupta2901/cheatsheets/blob/master/assets/life%20of%20a%20local%20variable.jpg)

* **A local variable** lives only within the method that declared the variable, in other words its scope is only within its own method. No other code in the class can see the local variable.  It is *alive* as long as its Stack frame is on the Stack, i.e. until the method completes. Once the method completes and its stack frame is popped from the stack, the local variables scoped in the method are destroyed too.

* Consider following example:

```java
public void doStuff() {
   boolean b = true;
   go(4);
}
public void go(int x) {
   int z = x + 24;
   crazy();
   // imagine more code here
}
public void crazy() {
   char c = 'a';
}
```

* This is what happens in the call stack:
  * ```doStuff()``` goes on the Stack. Variable ```b``` is alive and in scope.
  * ```go()``` is pushed on top of the Stack. ```x``` and ```z``` are alive and in scope, and ```b``` is alive but not in scope.
  * ```crazy()``` is pushed onto the Stack, with ```c``` now alive and in scope. The other three variables are alive but out of scope.
  * ```crazy()``` completes and is popped off the Stack, so ```c``` is out of scope and *dead*. When ```go()``` resumes where it left off, ```x``` and ```z``` are both alive and back in scope. Variable ```b``` is still alive but out of scope (until ```go()``` completes).

* While a local variable is alive, its state persists. As long as method ```doStuff()``` is on the Stack, for example, the ```b``` variable keeps its value. But the ```b``` variable can be used only while ```doStuff()```’s Stack frame is at the top. In other words, you can use a local variable only while that local variable’s method is actually running (as opposed to waiting for higher Stack frames to complete).

* **Reference variables**: The rules are the same for primitives and references. A reference variable can be used only when it’s in scope, which means you can’t use an object’s reference unless you’ve got a reference variable that’s in scope. 

* *How does variable life affect object life?*: An object is alive as long as there are live references to it. If a reference variable goes out of scope but is still alive, the object it refers to is still alive on the Heap. 

* **What happens when the Stack frame holding the reference gets popped off the Stack at the end of the method?** If that was the only live reference to the object, the object is now abandoned on the Heap. The reference variable disintegrated with the Stack frame, so the abandoned object is now, officially, garbag and now becomes eligible for garbage collection.**An object becomes eligible for GC when its last live reference disappears.**

* Once an object is eligible for garbage collection (GC), you don’t have to worry about reclaiming the memory that object was using. If your program gets low on memory, GC will destroy some or all of the eligible objects, to keep you from running out of RAM. You can still run out of memory, but not before all eligible objects have been hauled off to the dump. Your job is to make sure that you abandon objects (i.e, make them eligible for GC) when you’re done with them, so that the garbage collector has something to reclaim. If you hang on to objects, GC can’t help you and you run the risk Out Of Memory error.

* An object’s life has no meaning, no point, unless somebody has a reference to it. If you can’t get to it, you can’t ask it to do anything and it’s just waste of memory. If an object is unreachable, the Garbage Collector will figure that out. Sooner or later, that object will be garbage collected.

* There are three ways to get rid of object reference:
 1. **The reference gets out of scope, permanently.**

```java
 void go(){
 Life z = new Life();
 }
```
Here reference ```z``` dies at the end of the method. Lets look at another example:
```java
public class StackRef {
   public void foof() {
      barf();
   }

   public void barf() {
      Duck d = new Duck();
   }
}
```
* First ```foof()``` is pushed onto the Stack, no variables are declared. ```barf()``` is pushed onto the Stack, where it declares a reference variable, and creates a new object assigned to that reference. The object is created on the Heap, and the reference is alive and in scope.```barf()``` completes and pops off the Stack. Its frame disintegrates, so ```d``` is now dead and gone.The object ```d``` was referencing to is not elligible for garbage collection. Execution returns to ```foof()```, but ```foof()``` can’t use ```d```.
 
 2. **The reference is assigned another object**
```java
Life z = new Life();
z = new Life();
```
* The first object is abandoned, when ```z``` is provided reference of a new object. Lets look at another example:
```java
public class ReRef {
    Duck d = new Duck();
    public void go() {
      d = new Duck();
    }
}
```
* Here ```d``` is instance variable. So ```d``` lives in the heap inside an object of ```Reref```. It will live as long as the ```ReRef``` object that instantiated it is alive. A ```Duck``` object is created in the heap, and its reference is assigned to ```d```.  We are interested in the lifecycle of this ```Duck``` object.

* Since ```d``` will live as long as the object of ```ReRef``` (which instantiated it) is alive, this ```Duck``` too can live as long. but as soon as ```go()``` is called a new object of ```Duck``` is created and is assigned to ```d```. The first object of ```Duck``` is left abandoned. That first ```Duck``` is now as good as dead.

![abandoning object](https://github.com/shubhamgupta2901/cheatsheets/blob/master/assets/abandoning%20object%20way%202.jpg)

 3. **The reference is explicitly set to null**
```java
Life z = new Life();
z = null;
```
The first object is abandoned when we make the value of ```z``` null. Look at the following example: 

```java
public class ReRef {

    Duck d = new Duck();

    public void go() {
      d = null;
    }
}
```

* The new ```Duck``` goes on the Heap, referenced by ```d```. Since ```d``` is an instance variable, the ```Duck``` will live as long as the ```ReRef``` object that instantiated it is alive. Unless ```d``` is set to null, in which case the ```Duck``` object is abandoned and is elligible for garbage collection.



## Garbage Collection

#### What is garbage collection

* Garbage collection is looking at heap memory, identifying which objects are in use and which are not, and deleting the unused objects to reclaim heap space.
* An in-use object **(referenced object)** means that some part of your program still maintains a pointer to that object. An unused object **(unreferenced object)** is no longer referenced by any part of your program. So the memory used by an unreferenced object can be reclaimed.
* Garbage collection removes the burden of manual memory allocation/deallocation from us so that we can focus on business logic.
* Garbage Collection in Java is carried by a daemon thread called Garbage Collector.
* When the garbage collector thread is running, other threads are stopped, meaning the application is stopped momentarily.This is also known as **stop-the-world event**.

* **We cannot force garbage collection in Java**; it will only trigger if JVM thinks it needs a garbage collection based on Java heap size.There are methods like ```System.gc()``` and ```Runtime.gc()``` which is used to send request of Garbage collection to JVM but it’s not guaranteed that garbage collection will happen.

* Since JVM provides memory management, Java developers only care about creating object, they don't care about cleaning up, that is done by garbage collector, but it can only collect objects which has no live strong reference or it's not reachable from any thread. If an object, which should be collected but still lives in memory due to unintentional strong reference then it's known as **memory leak** in Java.

* If there is no memory space for creating new object in Heap Java Virtual Machine throws ```OutOfMemoryError``` or ```java.lang.OutOfMemoryError heap space```.

#### Generational Garbage Collection

* The garbage collection strategy used by JVM is generational garbage collection. Over time, it has proven to be the optimal solution.

* Generational garbage collection can be  defined as the strategy used by the garbage collector where the heap is divided into a number of sections called generations, each of which will hold objects according to their *age* on the heap.

* **Marking** Whenever the garbage collector is running, the first step in the process is marking. This is where the garbage collector identifies which pieces of memory are in use and which are not. This can be a very time-consuming process if all objects in a system must be scanned.

* The term **age** in generational garbage collection refers to the number of gc cycles the object has survived.

* How does it work?
  * First, any new objects are allocated to the **Eden** space. Both survivor spaces start out empty. When the Eden space fills up, a minor garbage collection is triggered. Unreferenced objects are deleted.Referenced objects are moved to the first survivor space **S0**. 
  * Eden is empty again and memory to new created objects is allocated here untill it fills up again. This is when the second minor gc is triggered. The same thing happens to the Eden space. Unreferenced objects are deleted and referenced objects are moved to a survivor space. However, in this case, they are moved to the second survivor space **S1**. In addition, objects from the last minor GC in the first survivor space **S0** have their age incremented and are moved to **S1**. Once all surviving objects have been moved to S1,  **S1** contains objects with different ages and both S0 and Eden space are cleared.
  * At the next minor GC, the same process is repeated. **However this time the survivor spaces switch**. Referenced objects are moved to **S0** from both Eden and **S1**. Surviving objects are aged. Eden and **S1** are cleared.
  * After every minor garbage collection cycle, the age of each object is checked. Those that have reached a certain threshold age, for example, 8, are promoted from the **young generation to the old generation**. For all subsequent minor GC cycles, objects will continue to be promoted to the old generation space.
  * Eventually, when the  old generation starts filling up, a major garbage collection will be performed on the old generation which cleans up and compacts that space. 
* * All the Garbage Collections are "Stop the World" events because all application threads are stopped until the operation completes. Since Young generation keeps short-lived objects, Minor GC is very fast and the application doesn’t get affected by this. However Major GC takes longer time because it checks all the live objects. So if you have a responsive application and there are a lot of Major Garbage Collection happening, you will notice timeout errors.

#### finalize method

* Before removing an object from memory garbage collection thread invokes ```finalize()``` method of that object and gives an opportunity to perform any sort of cleanup required.

* **It is possible to 'resurrect' an object that became eligible for garbage collection?** When an object becomes eligible for garbage collection, the GC has to run the finalize method on it. The finalize method is guaranteed to run only once, thus the GC flags the object as finalized and gives it a rest until the next cycle.

* In the finalize method you can technically “resurrect” an object, for example, by assigning it to a static field. The object would become alive again and non-eligible for garbage collection, so the GC would not collect it during the next cycle.

* The object, however, would be marked as finalized, so when it would become eligible again, the finalize method would not be called. In essence, you can turn this “resurrection” trick only once for the lifetime of the object. Beware that this ugly hack should be used only if you really know what you’re doing — however, understanding this trick gives some insight into how the GC works.


## TLDR
 
 * Unllike languages like C++, **memory is managed in JAVA**. This means after allocating memory to objects, we dont manually need to deallocate the memory, JAVA does that automatically. JVM has given this duty to **Garbage Collector(gc)**.
 
 * When we run an application and JVM starts up, it gets a chunk of memory **(native memory)** from the underlying OS and it uses it to run our JAVA program.JVM distributes this native memory to many subparts, but the most important ones are **Heap** and **JVM Stack**.
 
 * **Objects live in the Heap**.Whenever we create any object, it’s always created in the Heap space. Garbage Collection runs only on the heap memory to free the memory used by objects that doesn’t have any reference. Any object created in the heap space has global access and can be referenced from anywhere of the application.
 
 * For every thread of the application,JVM creates a Thread Stack inside the JVM Stack. When a method is run, a stack frame of that method is pushed to the thread stack. When we reach to the end of the method, the stack frame is popped out of the stack. This thing which is pushed is called as stack frame, it holds the state of the method including the value of local variables, which line of code is executing etc.
 
 * Where a variable lives depends on what kind of variable it is. By kind we don't mean type (primitive or object reference). The two kinds of variables are Instance variables and local variables.
 
 * A local variable is declared inside a method, including its parameters. These are temporary variables and live as long as the method lives. Once the stack frame of the method is popped from the stack, the memory is cleaned. The bytes which represent a primitive variable are actually the value of the variable. But the bytes which represent a reference variable are actually a reference to an object stored inside the Heap. So while the actual object is created in the heap, the variable (if a local variable) which refers to this object is actually stored inside the stack frame of the method. 

* Instance variables are declared inside a class but not inside a method. Instance variables live inside the object they belong to in the HEAP. A bytes representing a primitive variable is the value of the variable itself. But the bytes which represent a reference variable is actually a reference to an object. So a reference variable which is instance live inside an object in heap and its value is reference to another object in the heap which it points to.
