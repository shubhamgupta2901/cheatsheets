 ## Compilation and Execution of Java Program
 
 #### Compilers
* A program is written in a high level language which the machine does not understand. For the source code to be understood by the processor, it needs to be in a machine-level language, which could be understood by processors. Here comes the role of a compiler. The compiler converts the high-level language  into a format understood by the machines. Therefore, a compiler is a program that translates the source code for another program from a high level programming language into a sequence of machine instructions that can be executed by the CPU.

#### Bytecode and JVM
* However in case of JAVA it is different. The JAVA compiler (javac compiler) does not generate machine level instructions that can be understood by machines directly. It generates an intermediate bytecode. A Java runtime system called JVM (Java Virtual Machine) is required to interpret the bytecode and generate machine code which is understood by machines.

* So, in Java , all source code is first written in plain text files ending with the ```.java``` extension. Those source files are then compiled into ```.class``` files by the javac compiler. A ```.class``` file does not contain code that is native to your processor; it instead contains bytecode—the language of the JVM.

* A JVM depends of the operating system(platform dependent). So Mac OS X will have a different JVM and Windows will have a different JVM. 

* JVM is responsible for interpreting the bytecode and converting it into the machine code. A Windows JVM converts it to machine code that can be understood by Windows and a Mac OS JVM will convert the bytecode to a language understood by Mac OS.

#### Platform Independence

* A Platform= Hardware+Operating System. Anything which is platform indpendent can be run in any computer hardware and operating system. Java is platform indepedent so java program can be written in any platform and still run on any other 
operating system and hardware.

* This is because of the bytecode which is platform indepedent. When java compiler compiles any code then it generates the byte code not the machine native code(unlike C compiler). Now this byte code needs an interpreter to execute on a machine. This interpreter is JVM. So JVM reads that byte code(that is machine indepedent) amd execute it. Different JVM is designed for different OS and byte code is able to run on different OS.

#### Step by Step execution of Java program
 1. Whenever, a program is written in JAVA, the javac compiles it.
 2. The result of the JAVA compiler is the .class file or the bytecode and not the machine native code (unlike C compiler).
 3. The bytecode generated is a non-executable code and needs an interpreter to execute on a machine. This interpreter is the JVM and thus the Bytecode is executed by the JVM.
 4. And finally program runs to give the desired output.
 
 ## Data types in JAVA
 
 There are two types of data types in JAVA: 
  1. Primitive types: int, char, boolean, float etc
  2. Non-primitive(Object type): arrays, interfaces etc
  
  #### Primitive types
  
  | Data Type   | Default value | Size    | Range |
  | ----------- | ------------- |---------|-------|
  |  boolean    |  false        | 1 bit   |false, true |
  |  byte       | 0             | 8 bits  | −128 to 127 |
  |  char       | \u0000 (NULL) | 16 bits | 'u0000' (or 0) to 'uffff' (or 65,535, inclusive)|
  |  short      |  0            | 16 bits |−32768 to 32767 |
  |  int        | 0             |32 bits  | −2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647 |
  |  long       | 0L            | 64 bits | 9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,755,807 |
  |  float      | 0.0           | 64 bits | 3.4e−038 to 3.4e+038 |
  |  double     | 0.0           | 64 bits | 1.7e−308 to 1.7e+038 |

 #### A Closer look at char
 * In JAVA char is defined as 16 bits, (In C it was 8 bits). So the range of values a char can have ranges from Decimal 0 (Hexadecimal 0) to Decimal 65535 (Hexadecimal FFFF).
 
  * This allows JAVA to understand several dozen different character sets for a variety of languages, ranging from ASCII to the Shift Japanese Input System (SJIS) to Unicode. Internally, Java uses the Unicode character set.
 
 * Character set **ASCII** is a 7 bit character set. Thus it defines 2<sup>7</sup> or 128 different characters whose decimal values range from 0 to 127. 
   *  ASCII characters 0-31 and character 127 are nonprinting control characters. 
   * Characters 32-47 are various punctuation and space characters. 
   * Characters 48-57 are the digits 0-9. Characters 58-64 are another group of punctuation characters. 
   * Characters 65-90 are the capital letters A-Z. 
   * Characters 91-96 are a few more punctuation marks. 
   * Characters 97-122 are the lowercase letters a-z. 
   * Finally, characters 123 through 126 are a few remaining punctuation symbols. 
 *  All Java programs can be expressed in pure ASCII. Non-ASCII Unicode characters are encoded as Unicode escapes; that is, written as a backslash ( \), followed by a u, followed by four hexadecimal digits; for example, \u00A9. 
 
 *  **ISO Latin-1** is an 8-bit character set that’s a strict superset of ASCII. It defines 2<sup>8</sup> or 256 different characters whose numeric values range from Decimal 0 to Decimal 255 . The first 128 characters—that is, those numbers with the high-order bit equal to zero—correspond exactly to the ASCII character set. Thus 65 is ASCII A and ISO Latin-1 A; 66 is ASCII B and ISO Latin-1 B; and so on. Where ISO Latin-1 and ASCII diverge is in the characters between 128 and 255 (characters with high bit equal to one). ASCII does not define these characters. ISO Latin-1 uses them for various accented letters like ü needed for non-English languages written in a Roman script, additional punctuation marks and symbols like ©, and additional control characters.
 
 * **Unicode** 
   *  ISO Latin-1 suffices for most Western European languages, but it doesn’t have anywhere near the number of characters required to represent Cyrillic, Greek, Arabic, Hebrew, Persian, or Devanagari, not to mention pictographic languages like Chinese and Japanese. Chinese alone has over 80,000 different characters. 
   *  To handle these scripts and many others, the Unicode character set was invented. Unicode is a 2-byte, (16-bit) character set with 2<sup>16</sup> or 65,536 different possible characters. (Only about 40,000 are used in practice, the rest being reserved for future expansion.) Unicode can handle most of the world’s living languages and a number of dead ones as well.
   *  The first 256 characters of Unicode—that is, the characters whose high-order byte is zero—are identical to the characters of the ISO Latin-1 character set. Thus 65 is ASCII A and Unicode A; 66 is ASCII B and Unicode B and so on.
  * **UTF-8**
    *  Unicode is a relatively inefficient encoding when most of your text consists of ASCII characters. Every character requires the same number of bytes—two—even though some characters are used much more frequently than others. A more efficient encoding would use fewer bits for the more common characters. This is what UTF-8 does.
    *  In UTF-8 the ASCII alphabet is encoded using a single byte, just as in ASCII. The next 1,919 characters are encoded in two bytes. The remaining Unicode characters are encoded in three bytes. However, since these three-byte characters are relatively uncommon,especially in English text, the savings achieved by encoding ASCII in a single byte more than makes up for it.
    
  *  **The char Data Type** 
    *  Character-oriented data in Java is primarily composed of the char primitive data type, char arrays, and Strings, which are stored as arrays of chars internally. 
    *  In Java, a char is a two-byte, unsigned integer, the only unsigned type in Java. Thus, possible char values range from 0 to 2<sup>16</sup>(65,535). Each char represents a particular character in the Unicode character set. chars may be assigned to by using int literals in this range; for example:
    
    ``` char copyright = 169; ```
   chars may also be assigned to by using char literals; that is, the character itself enclosed in single quotes:
    ``` char copyright = '©'; ```
    
   *  With the exception of Unicode itself, most character sets understood by Java do not have equivalents for all the Unicode characters. To encode characters that do not exist in the character set you’re programming with, you can use Unicode escapes. A Unicode escape sequence is an unescaped backslash, followed by any number of u characters, followed by four hexadecimal digits specifying the character to be used. For example:

    ```char copyright = '\u00A9';```
  *  Unicode escapes may be used not just in char literals, but also in strings, identifiers, comments, and even in keywords, separators, operators, and numeric literals. The compiler translates Unicode escapes to actual Unicode characters before it does anything else with a source code file.
    



 ## Is JAVA Pass by value or Pass by reference
 #### Explanation 1
* Everything in Java is pass-by-value. There is no such thing as "pass-by-reference" in Java.Consider the below example, here calling ```badSwap()``` does not alter the values of variables.This is because when ```badSwap()``` is called, a copy of variables ```a and b``` is made in memory which contain the values of ```a and b``` and these variables are passed to  ```badSwap()```
```java
public static void main(String []args){
  Test test = new Test();
  int a = 10; 
  int b = 20;
  System.out.print(a); // Prints 10
  System.out.print(a); // Prints 20
  badSwap(a,b);
  System.out.print(a); // Prints 10
  System.out.print(a); // Prints 20
}
public static void badSwap(int var1, int var2)
{
  int temp = var1;
  var1 = var2;
  var2 = temp;
}
```
* The above method will also fail if we change the argument type from int to Object, since JAVA passes the object references by value as well.
 
* However consider the following snippet of code: 
 
 ```java
 class Point {
        int x;
        int y;

        Point(int x, int y) {
            this.x = x;
            this.y = y;
        }
 }
 
 public static void main(String [] args){
  Point pnt1 = new Point(0,0);
  Point pnt2 = new Point(0,0);
  System.out.println("X: " + pnt1.x + " Y: " +pnt1.y); //X: 0 Y: 0
  System.out.println("X: " + pnt2.x + " Y: " +pnt2.y); //X: 0 Y: 0
  System.out.println(" ");
  tricky(pnt1,pnt2);
  System.out.println("X: " + pnt1.x + " Y:" + pnt1.y); //X: 100 Y: 100
  System.out.println("X: " + pnt2.x + " Y: " +pnt2.y); //X: 0 Y: 0
 }
 
 public void tricky(Point arg1, Point arg2)
{
  arg1.x = 100;
  arg1.y = 100;
  Point temp = arg1;
  arg1 = arg2;
  arg2 = temp;
}
 ```
 
* The method successfully alters the value of pnt1, even though it is passed by value; however, a swap of pnt1 and pnt2 fails! 
  This happens because ```pnt1 and pnt2``` are actually references to a memory location where JAVA allocated memory to the object while object creation. So their values are actually reference to a memory location. When we pass ```pnt1 and pnt2``` to ```tricky()```, the call is actually CALL BY VALUE, but since the values of ```pnt1 and pnt2``` are actually references to a memory location, the method arguments too, will get the reference of same memory location. Because JAVA passes the references by value just like any other parameter.This means the references passed to the method are actually copies of the original references.
 Figure 1 below shows two references pointing to the same object after Java passes an object to a method.

![alt text](https://images.techhive.com/images/idge/imported/article/jvw/2000/05/03-qa-0512-pass1-100158781-orig.gif "")
 *After method call, the same memory will have two references.*

*  That is why the manipulation of object inside ```tricky()``` is acutally changing the values. However the swap part in ```tricky()``` is simply changing the values of the method arguments, i.e. method arguments will have swapped values, the references they are keeping will be interchanged. This still does not affect the value of original parameters ```pnt1 and pnt2```

![alt text](https://images.techhive.com/images/idge/imported/article/jvw/2000/05/03-qa-0512-pass2b-100158782-orig.gif "")

*Only the method references are swapped, not the original ones.*
 #### Explanation 2
* Java passes the parameters of method by value.The key to understanding this is that something like:

```java 
Dog myDog;
```
is not a Dog; it's actually a pointer to a Dog.

What that means, is when you have
```java
Dog myDog = new Dog("Rover");
foo(myDog);
```
you're essentially passing the address of the created Dog object to the foo method.(I say essentially because Java pointers aren't direct addresses, but it's easiest to think of them that way)
* Suppose the Dog object resides at memory address 42. This means we pass 42 to the method. if the Method were defined as
```java
public void foo(Dog someDog) {
    someDog.setName("Max");     // AAA
    someDog = new Dog("Fifi");  // BBB
    someDog.setName("Rowlf");   // CCC
}
```
let's look at what's happening.the parameter ```someDog``` is set to the value 42 at line "AAA" ```someDog``` is followed to the ```Dog``` it points to (the Dog object at address 42) that ```Dog``` (the one at address 42) is asked to change his name to ```Max``` at line "BBB" a new ```Dog``` is created. Let's say he's at address 74 we assign the parameter ```someDog``` to 74 at line "CCC" someDog is followed to the Dog it points to (the Dog object at address 74)
that ```Dog``` (the one at address 74) is asked to change his name to ```Rowlf``` then, we return
Now let's think about what happens outside the method:

Did ```myDog``` change?

There's the key.

Keeping in mind that ```myDog``` is a pointer, and not an actual ```Dog```, the answer is NO. ```myDog``` still has the value 42; it's still pointing to the original ```Dog``` (but note that because of line "AAA", its name is now "Max" - still the same ```Dog```; ```myDog's``` value has not changed.)

It's perfectly valid to follow an address and change what's at the end of it; that does not change the variable, however.
Java works exactly like C. You can assign a pointer, pass the pointer to a method, follow the pointer in the method and change the data that was pointed to. However, you cannot change where that pointer points.

* Remember JAVA has primitive types and reference types. ```boolean, byte, short ,char, int, long, float, double``` are primitive types, everything else are reference types. The variable of reference types hold the location of an object i.e objects reference and not its value.

 
 ## Singleton classes in JAVA
* In a object oriented environment, a singleton class is a class that can have only one object (an instance of the class) at a time.
*  After first time, we simply can not create the instance of a singleton class. We achieve this by making the constructors of the class private. 
* To design a singleton class:
  1.  Make constructor as private.
  2.  Write a static method that has return type object of this singleton class. Use it as an entry point for other classes to get access to its instance.
  
#### Implementing Singleton Class
```java
   // Java program implementing Singleton class with getInstance() method
class Singleton
{
    // static variable singleInstance of type Singleton
    private static Singleton singleInstance = null;
 
    // variable of type String
    public String s;
 
    // private constructor restricted to this class itself
    private Singleton()
    {
        s = "Hello I am a string part of Singleton class";
    }
 
    // static method to create instance of Singleton class
    public static Singleton getInstance()
    {
        if (singleInstance == null)
            singleInstance = new Singleton();
 
        return singleInstance;
    }
}
 
// Driver Class
class Main
{
    public static void main(String args[])
    {
        // instantiating Singleton class with variable x
        Singleton x = Singleton.getInstance();
 
        // instantiating Singleton class with variable y
        Singleton y = Singleton.getInstance();
 
        // instantiating Singleton class with variable z
        Singleton z = Singleton.getInstance();
 
        // changing variable of instance x
        x.s = (x.s).toUpperCase();
 
        System.out.println("String from x is " + x.s);
        System.out.println("String from y is " + y.s);
        System.out.println("String from z is " + z.s);
        System.out.println("\n");
 
        // changing variable of instance z
        z.s = (z.s).toLowerCase();
 
        System.out.println("String from x is " + x.s);
        System.out.println("String from y is " + y.s);
        System.out.println("String from z is " + z.s);
    }
}
  ```
*  Output
 ```
String from x is HELLO I AM A STRING PART OF SINGLETON CLASS
String from y is HELLO I AM A STRING PART OF SINGLETON CLASS
String from z is HELLO I AM A STRING PART OF SINGLETON CLASS


String from x is hello i am a string part of singleton class
String from y is hello i am a string part of singleton class
String from z is hello i am a string part of singleton class
 ```
 *  Explanation: In the Singleton class, when we first time call ```getInstance()``` method, it creates an object of the class with name singleInstance and return it to the variable. Since singleInstance is static, it is changed from null to some object. Next time, if we try to call getInstance() method, since singleInstance is not null, it is returned to the variable, instead of instantiating the Singleton class again. This part is done by if condition.

## Strings in JAVA
 
## JAVA Multithreading

* **Multitasking** :In old days, computer only had one CPU, and was only capable of executing a single program at a time. Later came multitasking which meant that computers could execute multiple programs (AKA tasks or processes) at the same time. It wasn't really "at the same time" though. The single CPU was shared between the programs. The operating system would switch between the programs running, executing each of them for a little while before switching.( Modern computers, though, come with multi core CPUs).

* **Multithreading**: Then came multithreading which means that you could have multiple threads of execution inside the same program. Multithreaded programs are able to simultaneously execute multiple sequences of instructions. Each instruction sequence has its own unique flow of control that is independent of all others. These independently executed instruction sequences are known as **threads**.Mutliple threads in a program are reading and writing the same memory simultaneously.
Threads are not complete processes in and of themselves. They are a separate flow of control that occurs within a process.

* **Physical vs Logical Concurrency**: In single CPU systems, only a single thread of execution occurs at a given instant. The CPU quickly switches back and forth between several threads to create the illusion that the threads are executing at the same time. Single-processor systems support **logical concurrency**, not **physical concurrency**.

Logical concurrency is the characteristic exhibited when multiple threads execute with separate, independent flows of control. On multiprocessor systems, several threads do, in fact, execute at the same time, and physical concurrency is achieved. The important feature of multithreaded programs is that they support logical concurrency, not whether physical concurrency is actually achieved.

#### **Ways to create Threads in JAVA**
There are two ways to start a thread in JAVA: 
  1. One is extend ```Thread``` class and override the implmentation of ```run()```.
  
  ```java
  
  class Runner extends Thread {

    String threadNumber;

    public Runner(String threadNumber) {
        this.threadNumber = threadNumber;
        System.out.println("Thread " + threadNumber + " initialized.");
    }


    public void run() {

        for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
            System.out.println("Thread " + threadNumber + ": " + i);
            try {
                Thread.sleep(1000);
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
        }
    }
}

public class Demo1 {

    /**
     * When we run main(), we can see that the two threads are running concurrently.
     * Notice we have called {@link Thread#start()} and not {@link Thread#run()}
     * This is because calling run() will run the code in the main thread of the application. So when {@link Thread#sleep(long)} method is called
     * it causes the currently executing thread to sleep (temporarily cease  execution), which is the main thread() and the code is run in sequential manner.
     * <p>
     * Calling start() will start a new thread, which will call run() in that thread, and interleaved output can be observed. Which means both the threads
     * are running concurrently.
     *
     * @param args
     */
    public static void main(String[] args) {

        Runner runner1 = new Runner(String.valueOf(1));
        runner1.start();

        Runner runner2 = new Runner(String.valueOf(2));
        runner2.start();


    }

}

```
ii.Second way is to start a thread in JAVA is to make your class implement ```Runnable``` and override ```run()```.Then we can pass this as a parameter to constructor of Thread class.
    
```java
    class Runner2 implements  Runnable{


    String threadNumber;

    public Runner2(String threadNumber) {
        this.threadNumber = threadNumber;
        System.out.println("Thread "+ threadNumber+" initialized.");
    }


    @Override
    public void run() {

        for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
            System.out.println("Thread "+ threadNumber+": " + i);
            try {
                Thread.sleep(1000);
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
        }

    }
 }
public class Demo2 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Thread thread  = new Thread(new Runner2("1"));
        thread.start();

        Thread thread2  = new Thread(new Runner2("2"));
        thread2.start();
    }
}
```
NOTE: If we call the ```run()``` instead of ```start()``` while creating the thread, the code inside ```run()``` will be executed but in the thread of calling method. In the above example it will run of main thread.

#### **Volatile keyword**

Consider the following example: 

```java
class Runner3 implements  Runnable{
    boolean running  = true;

    @Override
    public void run() {
        //Background thread
        while(running){
            System.out.println("Hello");
            try {
                Thread.sleep(300);
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
        }

    }

    public void stopRunning(){
        this.running = false;
    }
}
public class Demo3 {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Runner3 runner = new Runner3();
        Thread thread = new Thread(runner);
        thread.start();

        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        sc.nextLine();

        runner.stopRunning();

    }
}
```

As you can see, the value of running is never changed from the background thread. It is changed by a method that is called in the main thread of application. Which means the variable running is used by two threads.The expected behaviour of the above block of code is, Hello will keep printing, till somebody presses the Enter key.  And mostly the above code works fine.
In certain machines, or implementation of language, the value of running may be cached by the background thread.It might think that the value of ```running``` is never modified by me, so it can cache the value of ```running```. And everytime the while loop checks the value of ```running```, it is accessed from the cache and the value is always true. Which means when you press enter the while loop does not stop running.

##### synchronized keyword

Consider the following example: 

```java
public class Demo4 {

    private int count = 0;

    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        Demo4 demo = new Demo4();
        demo.doWork();
    }

    public void doWork() throws InterruptedException {

        Thread thread1 = new Thread(() -> {
            for (int i = 0; i < 10000; i++)
                count++;
        });

        Thread thread2 = new Thread(() -> {
            for (int i = 0; i < 10000; i++)
                count++;
        });

        thread1.start();
        thread2.start();

        /**
         * {@link Thread} class provides the join() method which allows one thread to wait until another thread completes its execution.
         * If t is a Thread object whose thread is currently executing, then t.join(); it causes the current thread to pause its execution

```
The expected answer here is 20000.Because both the threads are incrementing the value of count 10000 times each.
However if I run the code, it can be seen that the value of count is not always 20000(It is less than 20000).
The reason for this is ```count++ or count = count+1``` is actually a three step instruction to computer.
1)FETCH the value of count.
2)INCREMENT the value of count.
3)UPDATE the incremented value to count.

Since both the threads are concurrently using the count variable,there is a possibility that the value of count is INCREMENTED by thread1 but before UPDATING,the value of count is FETCHED by thread2.Suppose the value of count is 100, thread1 INCREMENTS the value, but before UPDATING the value, thread2 FETCHES the value of count which is still 100 so thread2 increments 100 to 101 but actually count should have been incremented from 101 to 102.
         
It can ofcourse be lot worse than that , like while thread2 is reading the value of count, count has already incremented it twice but before thread1's UPDATE, thread2's FETCH occurs.

 **Solution:**  Above, it can be seen that some of the increments of count has been skipped, because both the threads read the value concurrently and before the increment operation was completed and value was updated, the other thread would fetch the unupdated value and increment it.What we really need to do is, we need to find some way of making sure that in that time when a thread reads the value of count,incrments and stores it back to count, no other thread should access it and changed it. 
 
 **synchronized keyword**: Every object in JAVA has an intrinsic lock (monitor lock or mutex).When we use synchronized keyword while defining the method,  you have to acquire this intrinsic lock before you can call the method.Only one thread can acquire a thread at a time. So when one thread acquires this lock and runs {@link #increment()} and if another thread tries to call the method,then the second thread will have to wait until the first thread releases the intrinsic lock which happens when the method finshes execution.


``` java 
public class Demo5 {


    int count = 0;

    private synchronized  void increment(){
        count++;
    }

    private void doWork() throws InterruptedException {
        Thread thread1 = new Thread(() -> {
            for(int i = 0; i<100000; i++)
               increment();
        });
        Thread thread2 = new Thread(()->{
            for(int i = 0; i<100000; i++)
                increment();
        });

        thread1.start();
        thread2.start();

        thread1.join();
        thread2.join();

        System.out.println(count);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        Demo5 demo = new Demo5();
        demo.doWork();
    }
}
```
